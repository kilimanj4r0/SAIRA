### What is the main purpose of this course?


Advanced Networking is the core course for SNE program that provides the students with advanced knowledge about computer networks. The course starts with advanced networking topics such as quality of service (QoS), Multiprotocol Label Switching, and software defined networking (SDN). Furthermore, this course also covers some state of the art networking paradigms such as 5G Wireless Networks, and content delivery network (CDN). This course includes hands-on exercise and the students will practice their skills on the real hardware and software. Students will have the opportunity to apply the knowledge obtained in the class, on real hardware.
