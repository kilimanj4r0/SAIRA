Course outline
--------------


This course is designed for undergraduate students to provide comprehensive introduction and deep dive into human-computer interfaces. During the course, student will learn how to create and evaluate rich interactions, while considering the psychological and sociological aspects in the design process. More specifically, the course covers a subset of conceptual and memory models, tele-robotics, prototyping, analysis, interpretation and usability evaluation methods. In addition, we will also discuss commercial case. At the end of the course, students will be able to apply learn methods to design interface and evaluate the existing interaction between human and computer.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


This course will train you to apply interaction knowledge that involves human and computer. After this course, you will be able to:



* Understand the interaction abilities and limitations between human and machines
* Understand principle theories, design process, tools and techniques
* Reason about usability factor of user experience
* Analyze and identify requirements for new systems
* Develop prototypes and analyze user experience
* Design an appropriate interface and interaction style for the problem in hand
