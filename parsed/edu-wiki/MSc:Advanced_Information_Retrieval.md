### What is the main purpose of this course?


The course is designed to prepare students to understand background theories of information retrieval systems and introduce different information retrieval systems. The course will focus on the evaluation and analysis of such systems as well as how they are implemented. Throughout the course, students will be involved in discussions, readings, and assignments to experience real world systems. The technologies and algorithms covered in this class include machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, data indexing, and so on.
