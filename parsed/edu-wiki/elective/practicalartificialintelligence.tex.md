Course Characteristics
----------------------


What subject area does your course (discipline) belong to?
----------------------------------------------------------


Artificial intelligence



### Key concepts of the class


* Practical tools to implement artificial intelligence
* Methods and approaches to solving intellectual tasks


### What is the purpose of this course?


The course gives a general overview of the history, theoretical basis and technological stack for what we now call "artificial intelligence" (AI). Today AI is not only a research area, but also a complex set of exact algorithms, technologies, frameworks, software and services, which can be easily integrated in modern software. In this course students will learn the history, major theoretical points, structure of knowledge related to AI. The major goal of the course is to practice contemporary AI technologies and frameworks, including reasoning, natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Working individually and in teams, students will solve a variety of AI problems, both from scratch and using existing solutions.

By the end of the course, the students should be able to remember and recognize



* Ways to present and describe artificial intelligence in software solutions
* The best developed intelligent technologies that perform with near-human quality
* Ideas behind building intelligent systems in reasoning, natural language processing, recommendations, computer vision, speech processing
* Necessary parts to build an intelligent system with computer vision and machine learning technologies
* Factors to decide whether to go for AI or stay in conventional software development approach


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to describe and explain



* Major approaches to construct AI solutions
* Popular libraries and APIs to solve AI tasks
* Algorithms to construct intelligent agents from scratch
