Innovative Agile Software Development Methodology for High Reliability and Mission Critical Applications
========================================================================================================


The course is intended for practicing software engineers and software development process managers. Although the specific mention is made to commercial methodologies the students develop their own approach to “agile” for mission critical applications. The lectures present the students with the major issues related to the practical implementation of a development process for high reliability software applications. A particular focus is put on developing a “customer point of view” on the major characteristics of the software product. The 12 (interactive) lectures introduce the main problems connected to the software development life-cycle which the students experiment in the 10 connected exercises (tutored). The course activity helps students to understand mission critical environments and connected risks. The ability to understand complex requirements are tested through the analysis and design of conceptual applications such as Command and Control Systems. Innovative Agile techniques are used to build autonomous team procedures designed by the students.
