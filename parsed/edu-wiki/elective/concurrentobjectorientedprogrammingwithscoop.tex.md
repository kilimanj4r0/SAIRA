Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming with SCOOP
=================================================


Concurrent programming is more necessary than ever, but remains as hard as ever. Object-oriented mechanisms can in principle facilitate the task, but many concurrent frameworks do not take advantage of the abstraction and correctness guarantees offered by object technology. In this course students analyze the challenges of modern concurrent programming and review the major approaches available, then concentrate on the SCOOP model of computation, which holds promises of reliability and provability. The course has both a conceptual part and a hands-on component, where students will produce a concurrent Object-Oriented application such as a game. All concepts are defined, but it helps if students are already familiar with the fundamentals of concurrent programming. A reading list is provided in advance of the course so that interested students can brush up their knowledge of the field.
