PHIL-Knowledge and Perception
=============================


* **Course name:** Knowledge and Perception
* **Course number:**XYZ


Course Characteristics
----------------------


This course is an introduction to philosophy. It presents an historical overview of the main philosophical traditions that have informed and characterized the development of human thought.



### Key concepts of the class


* Rationalism
* Empiricism
* Deductive Reasoning
* Inductive Reasoning
* Empirical Science
* Applications of the Rationalism vs Empiricism debate in Modern Science
* Scientific Methodology


### What is the purpose of this course?


The main goal of the course is to give students a historical overview of the two main philosophical traditions (rationalism based on deductivism ,and empiricism based on inductivism) that fought one against the other in the history of human thought. A secondary goal of the course is to provide students with an informed understanding of the principles underlying the scientific method as well as a grasp of the concept of empirical science. A third goal of the course is to offer students a general awareness of how the battle between rationalism and empiricism has unfolded in our century beyond philosophy, in psychology and neuroscience.



### Course objectives based on Bloom’s taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to know the basics of Logic Reasoning. In particular, they should be able to remember:



* the basics of Plato’s epistemology
* the basics of Aristotle’s epistemology
* the basic tenets of rationalism
* the basic tenets of empiricism
* the Kantian synthesis
* the difference between deduction and induction
* the idea of empirical science
* the principles of the scientific method


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to understand:



* what is epistemology and why it is important
* the difference between internalist and externalist accounts of cognition
* how science progresses
* how philosophy influences science


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to apply the content of this course in all areas of their academic study but also in their working and daily life, with special reference to the following disciplines:



* computer science
* engineering
* robotics

| MidTerms

#### Final Exam (Oral)


The final exam will consist of an oral interrogation conducted by the Professor. Students will be questioned in deep on the content of the course and will be assessed for being able to present with accuracy what was presented, for showing their own ability to reflect on it, and apply the presented concepts in a variety of situations.



#### Video Presentations:


Video Presentations are to be done in groups defined by the instructor at his discretion, with a max duration of 5 minutes (300 seconds). Groups from 4 to 7 students should be proposed to the instructor by week 2 of the course; the instructor will then review them and finalize them by week 4. Notice, that even this is a group work, the contribution of each member of the group should be crystal clear and any attempt of skipping this component of the exam will trigger a D in the course. Video presentations can be done on logical fallacies, materials for self-study and preparation will be posted on Moodle by the Professor.



#### MidTerm Exam:


This exam will consist of quizzes and various exercises (such as open theoretical questions, multiple choices, and true/false questions). The Mid-Term will be held in class on week 8. The exam will last 75 minutes.



#### Attendance/Participation


Weekly exercises (hereby reports) must be submitted to the instructor the day after the lab sessions are over. Although reports are not marked, they directly count towards participation. Failure to submit reports will incur in a penalty of your final mark which will be proportional to the number of reports missing.

Electronic copies of these books are available on Moodle for download. Students must read and carefully study the mandatory readings (mostly weekly slides, handouts or relevant papers) ahead of each lecture. The materials for the course will be uploaded by the Professor on Moodle in due time. Please note: The lectures will be highly interactive and the students will be interrogated on the readings during the lectures, sometimes via kahoots (this approach is known as flipped learning).
