Design Fiction
==============


* **Course name:** Design Fiction
* **Course number:** HSS503


Course characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Speculative/Critical Design
* Emerging technologies


  




### What is the purpose of this course?


Today people are surrounded by technologies that have changed our lives. Science is
constantly advancing to introduce new solutions into daily routines. But how can we tell what a
particular technology would look like in the future? How will our lives be different because of
it?


By taking the best practice from science fiction, designers created an approach to explore
the future called Design Fiction. Design Fiction is the process of building a fictional world to
explore the impact of emerging technologies on society. Therefore, the purpose of the course is
to provide students with mindset and practical knowledge of design methods to critically assess
technology development trajectories and their impact on the society.



### Course Objectives Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy


#### What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to



* recognize and define design methods and design fiction, in particular;
* understand various phases of the design process in a collaborative multi-disciplined environment;
* describe user-oriented, iterative and systematic approach to problem solving;
* explain with examples of how technology accelerates exponentially;
* understand the necessity of logical succession in creating believable future scenarios;
* explain the ethical, moral, behavioral, cultural and social ramifications of design


  




#### What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to



* apply primary and secondary research to understand the trajectory of emerging technologies;
* apply design methods for building empathy with the users (interviews, ethnography, day-in-a-life);
* use creativity toolbox to create ideas and prototypes;
* use design fiction toolbox (sketching, models, mock-ups and mood boards, video and narrative);
* apply design-thinking strategies to evaluate, conceptualize and synthesize “integrated” design concepts.


#### What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to apply:



* analyse scientific literature showing development trajectory of emerging technologies;
* research human behavior in using emerging technologies, holistic human-machine interaction and overall experience;
* evaluate the impact of emerging technologies on society;
* create a believable, detailed design future;
* create artefacts that embody complex critical ideas and values.

### Methodological guidelines


The student is recommended the following scheme of preparation for classes:



* Revise class materials
* Study additional materials
* Do individual tasks
* Do team project work


### Late Submission Policy


This policy will be strictly applied in this course. If a personal emergency should arise that
affects your ability to turn in an assignment in a timely fashion, you must contact the course
instructor BEFORE the deadline to get a “Special Late Submission Approval” from the course
instructor. Without the “Special Late Submission Approval” submissions will be still accepted
up to 48 hours late, but with a 50% penalty. No “Special Late Submission Approval” will be
granted after the deadline. All late submissions should be submitted by email directly to the
instructors.



### Cooperation Policy and Quotations


We encourage vigorous discussion and cooperation in this class. You should feel free to discuss
any aspects of the class with any classmates. However, we insist that any written material that is
not specifically designated as a Team Deliverable be done by you alone. This includes answers
to reading questions, individual reports associated with assignments, and labs. We also insist that
if you include verbatim text from any source, you clearly indicate it using standard conventions
of quotation or indentation and a note to indicate the source.
