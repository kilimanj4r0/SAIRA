Mathematical Analysis I
=======================


Course Characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Differentiation
* Integration
* Series


### What is the purpose of this course?


This calculus course covers differentiation and integration of functions of one variable, with applications. The basic objective of Calculus is to relate small-scale (differential) quantities to large-scale (integrated) quantities. This is accomplished by means of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Should be understanding of the integral as a cumulative sum, of the derivative as a rate of change, and of the inverse relationship between integration and differentiation.


This calculus course will provide an opportunity for participants to:



* understand key principles involved in differentiation and integration of functions
* solve problems that connect small-scale (differential) quantities to large-scale (integrated) quantities
* become familiar with the fundamental theorems of Calculus
* get hands-on experience with the integral and derivative applications and of the inverse relationship between integration and differentiation.
