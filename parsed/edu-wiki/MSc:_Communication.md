Course outline
--------------


This course is designed to help computer science and engineering students improve their technical reading and writing skills. Students will read texts analytically, identify and respond to persuasion and argument, assess the visual and textual elements of written presentations, and develop skills including skimming and scanning, reading for gist, and reading critically. Coursework will support students in recognising the structural and rhetorical elements of technical genres, as well as constructing a portfolio of sample workplace text-types. The processes of drafting, revising and incorporating feedback will both model and inculcate editing methods and procedures. Attention will be given to teamwork, meeting behaviour, and minute-taking. Case studies are used to bring the textual and lived dimensions of technical communication together. Student reflection on their own learning experiences is a significant means of consolidating learning gains, over the course of the semester. Ultimately, the course provides opportunities for students to develop effective technical communication skills.
