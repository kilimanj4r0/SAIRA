Course outline
--------------


Distributed Ledgers are the technologies on which cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and all the blockchain-related technologies and applications are based on. Such technologies are an evolution of the ones at the base of the development of distributed systems and cryptographic technologies with a wide range of novel application domains. Moreover, the possibility of developing automated contracts (smart contracts) provides the tools to create distributed applications without any central control enabling a new development paradigm.
