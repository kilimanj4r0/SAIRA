Formative Assessment and Course Activities
------------------------------------------


### Ongoing performance assessment


#### Section 1





| Activity Type | Content | Is Graded?
 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Presentation | Prepare a short 2-minutes pitch for your project idea (2-5 slides). Suggested structure:What problem you are solving:- State the problem clearly in 2-3 short sentences.What methodology are you going to apply:- Shortly describe the method(-s) that could solve the problem. | 1
 |


#### Section 2





| Activity Type | Content | Is Graded?
 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Presentation of Current Progress | Prepare a short pitch for your current project progress (5-7 slides). Suggested structure:What problem you are solving:- State the problem clearly in 2-3 short sentences.What methodology are you going to apply:- Shortly describe the method(-s) that could solve the problem.Which tasks are you performing:- Shortly describe the tasks that are being solved.- Describe the current problems in realization if any. | 0
 |


#### Section 3





| Activity Type | Content | Is Graded?
 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Presentation (Project Defense) | Prepare a 5-minutes presentation on your project. During the presentation clearly define the role and contribution of each member of a team.Suggested structure:What problem you are solving:- State the problem clearly in 2-3 short sentences.What methodology is used:- Describe the method(-s) that were used to solve the problem.What are the results:- Describe what you achieved during the course. | 1
 |


### Final assessment


**Section 1**



1. Grading criteria for the midterm project presentation:
2. 1. Problem: short clear statement on what you are solving, and why it’s important.
3. 2. Methodology: clear statement of the methods to be used.


**Section 2**



1. The activity in this section is not graded. The presentation is needed only to see the current state of the project realization.


**Section 3**



1. Grading criteria for the final project presentation:
2. 1. Problem: short clear statement on what you are solving, and why it’s important.
3. 2. Methodology: clear statement of the methods used.
4. 3. Results: students provided the achieved results and can interpret them


### The retake exam


**Section 1**



1. For the retake, students have to follow the guidelines of the course and contribute to a new project. The complexity of the product can be reduced, if it is one person working on it. The grading criteria for each section are the same as for the final project presentation. There has to be a meeting before the retake itself to plan and agree on the project content, and to answer questions.
2. P7. Activities and Teaching Methods by Sections
3. Mark what techniques and methods are used in each section (1 is used, 0 is not used).
