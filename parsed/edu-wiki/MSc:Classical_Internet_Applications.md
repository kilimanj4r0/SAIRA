Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


CIA course serves as kick-start for the security and network engineering Masters program. Before diving into the depth of the topics, the students must know preliminary concepts related to computer networks services and applications therein. This course is designed to cover the basic services offered by the Internet including operating systems and computer architecture. The concepts from this course will be used throughout the course of whole masters. More precisely, this course will cover the basic computer architecture and assembly language programming, Domain Name Services (DNS), DNSSec, email, web, directories, and disks. This course will also cover protocols and ABNF. The theory part will strengthen the theoretical aspects of the concepts whereas the lab exercises will provide the students with the opportunity to have hands-on experience of the ideas they learnt in the lectures.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Identify different Internet applications and understand their working principles from the protocols point of view
* Demonstrate the acquired knowledge and skills in classical internet applications including DNS, Email, and Directory services.
* Able to write regular expressions and context-free grammar that are essential in Internet applications and information exchange through the networks
* Able to partition disks and remember the booting principles as well as secure booting


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Demonstrate knowledge and skills to use web services
* Demonstrate the essential knowledge of disks and calculate particular locations/addresses in disks
* Reason about problems in the current DNS and the need to upgrade to DNSSEC and DNS over HTTPS
* Demonstrate the knowledge of email and other services configuration


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Install, Configure, update, and manage DNS services over a network
* Configure, maintain, and update the secure DNS over a network
* Update, add, and delete records in DNS
* Configure a secure mail server and maintain it
* Get hands-on experience of the afore-mentioned technologies on their own servers.
