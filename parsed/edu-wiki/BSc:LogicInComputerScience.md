Course outline
--------------


In recent years, powerful tools for verifying software and hardware systems have been developed. These tools rely in a crucial way in logical techniques. Propositional and predicate logic are presented in detail, as well as some specialized logics (temporal logics) used for reasoning about the correctness of computer systems. A sound basic knowledge in logic is a welcome prerequisite for courses in program verification, formal methods and artificial intelligence. The course presents: propositional, predicate and temporal logics, as well as software verification techniques such as Hoare-style axiomatic semantics, model-checking and testing.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


After taking the course, students will be able to



* explain the notion of model of a first-order language and the meaning of the completeness and soundness theorems
* describe the principles behind fundamental software verification techniques.
* apply the principles to the construction of verification tools, in particular program provers.
* 
* 
* judge the relevance of logical reasoning in computer science
* analyse the applicability of logical tools to solve problems in computer science, i.e. finding bugs with the use of model checking


Expected acquired core competences
----------------------------------


* write and check proofs in natural deduction for propositional and predicate calculus
* specify properties of a reactive system using logic .
* apply different techniques and tools for program proving.
