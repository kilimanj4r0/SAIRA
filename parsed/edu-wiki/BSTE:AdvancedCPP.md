Advanced C++
============


C++ still remains the most widely used language in industry for implementing big and very big software projects. The language is actively evolving; the C++ Working Group within the ISO is working hard issuing new language standards. The latest editions were C++14 and C++17. Many new important concepts and features were added to the language, and the new standard C++20 is being prepared. This requires developers to keep in sync with the newest updates in the language.
Also, some important language features added to C++ even before 2014, are still not in common use because of its relative complexity and the absence of clear explanations (textbooks, papers etc.).
The course aims to overcome the gap between the current state of the C++ language and the limited subset of the language that is in actual use by C++ developers. Most important new language features are carefully introduced, discussed, and explained on typical code examples.
