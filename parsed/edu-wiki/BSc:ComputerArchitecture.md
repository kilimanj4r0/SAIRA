### What is the main purpose of this course?


The main purpose of this course is to cover the fundamental theoretical principles of computer systems design. We first overview the key hardware components of a modern computer system, available performance metrics, and the general principles of computer architecture. We then discuss the representation and execution of computer instructions, instruction set architecture, the translation hierarchy of a high-level program into machine code. We also cover the elements of computer arithmetics, logic circuits, including combinational and sequential logic circuits. These theoretical principles are illustrated by using MIPS instruction set architecture, FPGA, and Verilog HDL programming language during the labs. We then study in details simple and pipelined implementation schemes of a processor, the idea of a pipelined execution, related hazards and their solutions. We complete the course by introducing several advanced topics, including computer security and vulnerabilities, GPU programming, and modern principles for memory hierarchy design.

**Section 1**



1. Briefly describe the principles of Von Neumann architecture. Illustrate with a diagram.
2. Describe the steps that transform a program written in a high-level language such as C into a representation that is directly executed by a computer processor. Illustrate with a diagram; provide a brief description for each step.
3. Consider three different processors P1, P2, and P3 executing the same instruction set. P1 has a 3 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.5. P2 has a 2.5 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.0. P3 has a 4.0 GHz clock rate and has a CPI of 2.2. Answer the following questions: a) Which processor has the highest performance expressed in instructions per second? b) If the processors each execute a program in 10 seconds, find the number of cycles and the number of instructions. c) We are trying to reduce the execution time by 30% but this leads to an increase of 20% in the CPI. What clock rate should we have to get this time reduction?
