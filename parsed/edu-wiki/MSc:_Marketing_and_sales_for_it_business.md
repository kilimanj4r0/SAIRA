### Recommendations for students on how to succeed in the course


The student is recommended the following scheme of preparation for classes:  
Marketing and sales are much more about hypothesis testing and math, than creativity. Therefore, it is so important for students to try the acquired knowledge in real practice, doing small tasks after each lecture.  
Finally, we will try to assemble a working strategy for a startup from these tasks.  
Moreover:  
Participation is important. Showing up is the key to success in this course.  
Reading the recommended literature is optional, and will give you a deeper understanding of the material.
