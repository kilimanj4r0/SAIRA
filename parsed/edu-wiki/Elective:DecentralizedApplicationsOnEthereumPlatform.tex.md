Decentralized Applications on Ethereum platform
===============================================


During the course, students learn the fundamental principles and techniques that can be applied to design and develop decentralized applications. This course covers basics of Ethereum platform: clients (Parity, go-ethereum), smart contracts languages (Solidity, Serpent, LLL, Viper), EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and assembly opcodes, popular development frameworks (Truffle, Embark, DappHub), Javascript interface (Web3), Tooling (Remix, TestRPC). During the course, students cover security practices and optimizations and develop several decentralized applications, including ERC20 token application, commonly used in crowdfunding. The course includes graded homeworks.
