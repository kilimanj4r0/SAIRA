ABOUT LECTURING A COURSE
========================


The old version of the regulations to consider is <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pk0J5C1LIkXHz-aPMCXZPr1SSD0YsLULJ8IslahdyOU/edit>.



Course Structure and Syllabus
-----------------------------


Faculty members can use any instructional mode; however, they should always make sure to
develop and communicate the objectives of the course to the students. In regards to this, the
instructors of the courses should prepare the course syllabus for all of your courses and share
them with the Department of Education (DoE) before a semester begins.
The template that IU is currently using for the course syllabus is in the appendix (Add as an
appendix the template for the syllabus). Such template is then reflected by the DoE into
the online teaching infrastructure (currentlyMoodle) and is used as the core reference for
supplying course material, schedules, and calendars to students.
The deadlines to prepare and submit the syllabus are June 30 (for Fall semester courses),
October 31 (for Spring semester courses), May 01 (for Summer semester courses).
The instructor of the course is expected to teach with physical presence at least 70% of
the lectures.



Evaluation of students performance
----------------------------------


The following is stipulated by the University Regulation “Ongoing and interim assessment
of students’ knowledge in the autonomous noncommercial organization of higher education
«Innopolis University».”



### Ongoing academic progress assessment (OPA)


1. Ongoing academic progress assessment (OPA) is carried out by all types of self-study
and contact work of students prescribed by the disciplines, practices, and programs
of research work. The OPA is carried out by a professor giving courses, by the head of
practice, or by the tutor of the research work.


2. The forms of the OPA include:



* individual realization of software code,
* individual assignments,
* practical and laboratory work,
* projects,
* examinations,
* colloquiums,
* tests (hand-written or computer-based),
* reports, essays, surveys,
* oral polls,
* discussions, training, workshops.


3. Other forms of OPA might be established in accordance with the curriculum and
schedule.


4. The Instructor determines the frequency, the procedure, and the forms of OPA, as well
as the evaluation system for it. The Instructor has a right to introduce corrections in
the quantity and procedure of OPA.


5. The Instructor must enter OPA results into the LMSMoodle.


6. The OPA results must be taken into account when the final grade is given during course
evaluation. Grades received by students during the OPA are not subject to retake.



### Studentsmid-semester evaluation


Within the framework of the educational process’s quality assessment, the IU Department
of Education analyzes students’ progress based on the OPA results around the middle of
each semester. Based on this analysis, members of the DoE hold special meetings with the
under-performing students to assess the reasons behind their struggling. The following
procedures are in place:


1. Each course instructor should estimate students’ performance by the end of the 9th
week of the semester. This is an estimation of individual students’ final grade


2. Such an estimate should be entered in the Moodle section of the course using an
assessment named “Mid Semester Evaluation (for DoE)”


3. Such an estimate should be defined with the usual letter grades (A, B, C, D - where D
means “fail”)


It is noteworthy that the mid-semester evaluation is not the same as the midterm evaluation.


  




### Final evaluation


The official term for the final course evaluation is the “Interim assessment” (IA), and it will
be used below. The following is stipulated by the University Regulation “Ongoing and interim
assessment of students’ knowledge in the autonomous noncommercial organization of higher
education Innopolis university":


1. The schedule and the place of IA are drafted by the DoE one week prior to the beginning
of an IA, which must be approved by the Director of the University. Academic
faculty and students must be informed of this via their corporate e-mails.


2. The IA is conducted after completing the course or practice in full or in part. This assessment
will take place in a form that depends on the educational program, the work
program of the discipline (course modules) and following the procedures, prescribed
by relevant regulations.


3. The forms of interim assessment are:



* a test (including a pass/fail test),
* an examination.


Both of these can be carried out in the following forms:



* verbally and in a written form,
* in the form of testing, including the use of computers, software and hardware, as


well as



* in the form of an essay or
* project defense.


The form of the interim assessment is determined by the Instructor. Students must
be informed about the IA form.


4. The final grade for the course (module) and practice (research work) can include the
results of the OPA.


5. Recording the IA results can be conducted in the following 2 ways:



* The Instructor enters IA results into the LMSMoodle after which the results are


transferred into the intermediate attestation report.



* The Instructor fills out the intermediate attestation report (Appendix 1 of the


cited document) and submits it to the DoE. The DoE employees then transfer the grades into LMSMoodle.


6. The results cannot be reviewed after being entered into LMS Moodle and the interim
assessment report.


7. Final results of the examination (tests) from the interim assessment report shall be entered
into the student’s electronic record books (LMS Moodle, a system of educational process control 1C: University, student’s portfolio, and student’s personal account
(my.university.innopolis.ru)).



### Rules on final examinations


1. If a student has no valid reason for being absent from the exam, he/she is considered
to not have passed the exam and not fulfilled academic requirements.


2. The Instructor can provide the list of supportive materials that students are allowed
to use during the exam.


3. The use of non-allowed supportive materials during the exams, breach of study discipline
(cheating, use of mobile phones or PC, attempts to talk to others, etc.) as well as
infringement of the regulations is prohibited. These incidents can serve as a ground
for removal of the student from the room and awarding thema D (unsatisfactory) or
F (Fail) marks.


4. If any of the incidents described above occur, the Instructor should inform the Vice-
Rector for Education of this in written form or via the corporate mail. The Vice-Rector
in their turn sends an official note on Regulations infringement to the Director of the
University for further consideration and decision.


5. Presence of the third parties on exams and tests without the written permission of the
Vice-Rector for Education of the University is not allowed.


6. Students with an individual education plan may pass tests and exams only during the
period determined by their individual education plan.


7. Students with a valid reason of absence (illness, family circumstances, etc.) who were
not able to pass tests and exams within the established timeframe are permitted to
retake an exam on individual terms. The terms are approved by the direct order of the
University Director.


8. For students who provide justification documents for their absence in the exam (sick leave
sheet, medical certificate, etc.), the examination period may be extended by the number
of calendar days indicated in the presented document. This document should be
provided no later than three working days after being issued.


9. The following procedure is applied for the extension of the examination session:



* A student provides the DoE with:


1) A statement in the name of Vice-Rector
for Education to extend the examination period; 
2) Documents confirming the
reason for the extension of the examination period (a medical certificate or other
documents).



* The Vice-Rector for Education examines the submitted documents and visas


student’s statement.



* Based on this, the Department of Education of the University drafts submission


for the Director on the extension of the examination period, indicating a concrete number of extension days.


10. A student is not allowed to have an extension of the exam period if he/she does not submit
the justification document in time.

Academic misconduct policy
--------------------------


### Definitions


Primary instructor (PI) or professor – course primary instructor. Teaching assistant (TA) –
any other instructor involved in teaching a course. Instructor – PI or TA.
Academic misconduct -— any action or attempted action that may result in creating an
unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for
any other member or members of the academic community. Include but not limited by:



1. cheating (including plagiarism),
2. fabrication or alteration of information and documents (lies in general),
3. theft,
4. sabotage (lesson disruption, bomb calls, fire alarms).


Students shall be considered to be cheating if involved in any of the following: using
unauthorized cheat sheets, opening books during closed-book tests, talking during tests,
plagiarising (as defined by instructor), or in any other case of cheating detected.
Plagiarism can take several forms, including but not limited to:



1. Using the exact words of another student.
2. Copying and pasting materials from the Internet or other electronic resources without


proper citation, quotation or referencing.



1. Accepting excessive assistance from another person in writing.
2. Writing a computer program that is the same or closely similar to public sources or


solutions of other students.


The similarity is a machine-determined score that should not exceed the given percentage.
The percentage is determined by the regulation document for the exact work (e.g. course
project, BS/MS thesis, or coding assignment). Similarity can include quotations, in-text
citations, names, titles, terms, and code. Similarity can be measured:



1. among students’ works,
2. as well as with other datasets.


Similarity checks shall only be applied to long text works in natural or programming language
to prove the fact of copying. For example, similarity reports are a necessary part of thesis
validation procedure and coding assignments, but such reports cannot be applied to exam works and tests, where similarity does not necessarily mean copying. As there is no universal
scale for similarity, for each particular assignment and course professor should clearly specify
expectations for similarity in the policy document or in assignment notification. If a group
of students receives the same assignment, not passing a similarity check shall be treated as
plagiarism. If a student is doing a personal task (thesis, project, ...), high similarity cases shall
be managed by the supervisor. In our university, we use jPlag for code similarity detection,
Turnitin for essay check and Antiplagiat for thesis check. If you want to get tutorials on these
systems, please contact the Department of Education (education@innopolis.ru).



### Statement


All academic misconduct cases shall be reported to the IU Department of Education (DoE)
and Student Affairs Office (SAO) using the official email address (education@innopolis.ru,
319@innopolis.ru). Specify the following:



1. Student(s) name(s) involved and their roles;
2. Date and time the case was detected;
3. Course affected by the situation;
4. Short description of the situation. Please refer to this policy or other policy documents


which you use to identify the misconduct.


The Student Affairs Office should create a track record of student’s activities including
misconduct cases starting from the Bootcamp participation until the final thesis defense.
We assume that there is a publicly available cheating policy document for the whole
course, particular assignment, or exam, i.e. it is clear if it is allowed or not to use electronic
devices, notes, cheat sheets, books, etc. during the tests. Any violation of the said policy, as
well as plagiarism cases, shall be considered equally.
The committee decision shall be taken with a consensus of all participants.
The process participants shall be able to know the committee members.
The committee shall be of 3 people: a course professor, a teacher not involved in the
course affected, and an official student representative.
Cases involving the first-year students should be considered with the most thoroughness.



### Procedure


Should an instructor (teaching assistant or professor) have reason to believe that one or more
works are copied from unauthorized resources, and action on a test is taken in violation, or work of one student is copied from another (as defined in plagiarism clarification), the
the procedure below shall be followed.



1. The instructor shall report the case to DoE and SAO (education@innopolis.ru and 319@innopolis.ru).
2. The instructor shall inform the suspected students about the above finding separately, and discuss this incident. They shall be penalized as per the recommendations below and a report will be submitted to DoE outlining these decisions. In case of copying from each other—both students shall be penalized. The actions of the instructor are considered final.
3. In the event of an appeal to the DoE, the student must present a clear written rationale for why the decision was in error. If the DoE agrees that the student appeal has merit then an appeal committee is formed of one student representative, the course PI, and an unrelated professor selected by the DoE. Otherwise, the decision of the course PI is considered final and the report is entered.


* The student shall contact the committee and provide the said committee with the following materials: a cheating policy for this course/test/exam, students’ papers/code, any other findings, including the student’s arguments.
* The committee shall study the above materials.
* The committee can contact the students to listen to their arguments or ask questions. However, this shall be upon the committee’s discretion.
* The committee shall make an appeal decision to either accept or reject. This decision shall be final.
* Any fabrications of data or false statements made to the DoE or the Committee during the appeals process will be seen as a separate instance of misconduct and the DoE or the Committee may impose additional outcomes if necessary when the actions have impeded investigation.


#### Procedure from instructor’s point of view


1. Instructor reports the violation case to DoE and SAO.
2. Instructor notifies students involved (can be BCC in report email).
3. In case of student’s appeal, instructor may be invited to participate in committee.


#### Procedure from student’s point of view


1. The student gets a notification about academic misconduct.
2. The student may appeal. He/she collects the documents (3.a) and submits to DoE and


SAO.



#### Procedure from an administration point of view


1. DoE and SAO get the report about student misconduct.
2. SAO tracks the record and asks DoE to act in case violation is not the first (see penalty section).
3. In case of student’s appeal, DoE with the help of programmanagers collects a committee.


### Penalty


Note that the following are the minimal actions.



1. Should a student be found to have committed misconduct for the first time, such a student shall receive zero points for the particular work (assignment/exam/test/homework)
2. Should a student be found to have committed misconduct for the second time, the following actions shall be taken:
	1. Such a student shall:
		1. receive zero points for the course (or courses if 2 cheating instances are detected in different courses);
		2. be sent to retake.
	2. An official warning shall be issued for the said student.
3. Should a student be found to have committed misconduct for the third time (without respect to the course), such a student shall be expelled from Innopolis University.


In the event that the actions were of a grievous nature, e.g. a student using a work for hire
an assignment, a bomb/shooting threat, etc., the DoE maintains the right to increase the
outcomes. A student might also be subject to additional actions on the part of the professor
or DoE in order to maintain class order, have recompense of the action, or in order to learn a
proper scholarly methodology, e.g. be required to make an apology to classmates affected, be
required to write an essay or attend a course on how to cite properly, etc.
