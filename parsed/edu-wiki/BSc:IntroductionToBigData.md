Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


Software systems are increasingly based on large amount of data that come from a wide range of sources (e.g., logs, sensors, user-generated content, etc.). However, data are useful only if it can be analyzed properly to extract meaningful information can be used (e.g., to take decisions, to make predictions, etc.). This course provides an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies, tools, architectures, and systems constituting the big data computing solutions landscape. Particular attention will be given to the Hadoop ecosystem that is widely adopted in the industry.
