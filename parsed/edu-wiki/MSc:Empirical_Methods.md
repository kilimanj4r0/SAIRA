---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


The main purpose of this course is to present the fundamentals of empirical methods and fundamental statistics to the future software engineers and data scientists, on one side providing the scientific fundamentals of the disciplines, and on the other anchoring the theoretical concepts on practices coming from the world of software development and engineering. As a side product, the course also refreshes the basics of statistics, providing the basis for more advanced statistical courses in the following semester(s) of study.
