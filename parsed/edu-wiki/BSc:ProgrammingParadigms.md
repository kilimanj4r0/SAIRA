Course outline
--------------


In this course we will be thoroughly considering fundamental aspects of current programming languages and the most important paradigms in modern programming such as imperative, object-oriented, generic, and functional programming. These paradigms are now in active use by multi-million army of software developers all over the world and form the mandatory basis of success for every software professional in the 21st century. We will consider fundamental theoretical issues which are “under the hood" of modern programming. But the main attention will be drawn on practical aspects of understanding and using paradigms mentioned above. We will carefully study those paradigms using a lot of small and big program examples written in different programming languages; some of the examples will be given as practical tasks for the students. The primary focus of this course is exposing the students to the fundamental concepts of modern programming approaches, techniques and patterns and of practical aspects in programming in modern programming languages, rather than teach them to use a specific language, a particular tool or technology.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


The course will provide an opportunity for participants to:



* Understand key principles and techniques related to the programming paradigms discussed.
* Become familiar with important techniques and best practices for solving problems in software development.
* Choose paradigms and corresponding design patterns suitable for a particular software problem.
* Get hands-on experience in modern programming.
