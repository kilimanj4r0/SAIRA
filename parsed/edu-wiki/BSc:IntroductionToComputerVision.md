Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


This course provides an introductory but detailed treatment of computer vision techniques using machine learning, with an emphasis on implementing the computer vision algorithms from the scratch and using them to solve real-world problems. The course will begin with the image representation, but will quickly transition to computer vision techniques using machine learning, finishing with image segmentation and object detection and recognition. A key focus of the course is on providing students with not only theory but also hands-on practice of building their computer vision applications.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Significant exposure to real-world implementations
* To develop research interest in the theory and application of computer vision


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Suitability of different computer vision models in different scenarios
* Ability to choose the right model for the given task


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Hands on experience to implement different models to know inside behavior
* Sufficient exposure to train and deploy model for the given task
* Fine tune the deployed model in the real-world settings
