Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


The main goal of the course is to give students a historical overview of the two main philosophical traditions (rationalism based on deductivism and empiricism based on inductivism) that fought one against the other in the history of human thought. A secondary goal of the course is to provide students with an informed understanding of the principles underlying the scientific method as well as a grasp of the concept of empirical science. A third goal of the course is to offer students a general awareness of how the battle between rationalism and empiricism has unfolded in our century beyond philosophy, in psychology and neuroscience.
