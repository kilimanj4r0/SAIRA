Course outline
--------------


This course gives the knowledge in data analysis and interpretation. It starts by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. It also describes the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrates how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data. Moreover, the course gives a brief introduction to machine learning and apply it to high-throughput data. It presents the general idea behind clustering analysis and descript K-means and hierarchical clustering and demonstrate how these are used in describe prediction algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors along with the concepts of training sets, test sets, error rates and cross-validation. The students will be required to participate in laboratory practicum and solve practical tasks using hardware and Python environment.
