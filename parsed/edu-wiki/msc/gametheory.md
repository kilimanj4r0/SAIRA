Game Theory
===========


* **Course name:** Game Theory
* **Course number:** R-01


Course Characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Game Theory: Basics of the mathematical theory of games, including Nash Equilibrium, Mixed Strategies, and Evolutionary Game Theory
* Applications of Computer Programming: Implementation of Game Playing agents


### What is the purpose of this course?


Game Theory is a powerful method to make predictive decisions about common business cases and acts as a foundational course to decision making in AI systems, such as Bayesian techniques and game trees and Monte Carlo Tree Search. As such the purpose of this course is to provide a solid foundation on the basic structures of mathematical games including the canonical 2 by 2 structures of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, Chicken, Hawk and Dove, and Battle of the Sexes. Then looks at more complicated business examples such as price setting, making credible threats and promises. It also gives practical instruction on the application of computers in game playing, especially tournament play and the development of decision-making models.



### Course objectives based on Bloom’s taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to give basic definitions of games



* Should be able to define Nash Equilibrium, Domination, Mixed v. Pure Strategies
* Should be able to define Evolutionary Stability
* Should be able to define a number of common agent types (always cooperate/defect, Tit-for-tat, Grudger)


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to understand the basic



* A student should understand how game theory affects common daily situations, such as internet trade (as a PD)
* Should understand the role of Evolutionary Stable Strategies
* Should understand the history of tournaments as methods to evaluate agent play


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to apply game theory to solve problems in limited real world cases.



* Program a finite state machine to play iterated games
* Apply both domination and Nash equilibrium to solve pure games
* Apply both domination, Nash equilibrium, and mixed strategies to solve mixed strategic games
