Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


Formal models and formal methods are gaining an increasing importance today - in academia and in industry - in particular due to the emerging of tool support used for modeling and analysis of systems. An important question is asked world-wide when developing academic curricula: what a software engineer should know about formal modeling? On what specific aspect a course should focus and help the perspective engineer to navigate such a complex and fast changing field? The course attempt to give a partial although consistent answer to this question by providing an introduction to the foundations and uses of formal modeling. The course can be seen as organized in three parts: the first part sets out the mathematical foundations on which the rest of the course is based. It presents the mathematical concepts, such as logics, proofs, theories, sets, functions, relations, etc., on which all modern modeling approaches build. The second part presents the concepts that allow to relate mathematics to computation and to software: state machines, invariants, pre- and post-conditions, proving properties about programs. The third part consists of particular notations and method of formal modeling showing how the general concepts of the second part can be turned into effective engineering tools.
