OOP and Software Architecture
=============================


* **Course name:** OOP and Software Architecture
* **Course number:** XYZ


Course Characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Principles of OOP and their implementation in modern languages
* Principles and foundations of software architecture
* Architecture patterns and their use
* Approaches to design high quality software meeting requirements
* Architectural issues and their impact on software design
* Formal notations and specifications with related tools


### What is the purpose of this course?


Software developers often follow architectural and design patterns informally without deep understanding of the subject. This prevents the delivered software to work optimally and often to meet functional and nonfunctional requirements. The course provides a detailed understanding of software architectures and how they should be used by software developers and in the software engineering process.



### Course objectives based on Bloom’s taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* How to use principles of software architecture and to design and develop code following these principles
* Understand architecture patterns and apply them in practical software design
* How to design high quality software meeting requirements
* Understand formal notations and related tools and use them in practical design


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* How to create high quality software using mainstream concepts of programming
* What is object-oriented programming and its main advantages
* How to increase the level of abstraction with help of genericity
* How to create concurrent programs and what are the main issues related to this kind of programming


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* to be able to design and develop high quality programs in any OO programming language

* overall course contribution (to accumulate extra-class activities valuable to the course progress, e.g. a short presentation, book review, very active in-class participation, etc.) up to 6 points.


#### Interim performance assessment:


* in-class tests up to 10 points for each test (i.e. up to 40 points in total for 2 theory and 2 practice tests),
* computational practicum assignment up to 10 points for each task (i.e. up to 30 points for 3 tasks).


#### Exams:


* mid-term exam up to 30 points,
* final examination up to 30 points.


#### Overall score:


100 points (100%).
