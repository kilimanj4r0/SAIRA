Human-Computer Interaction Design
=================================


The goal of the course is to teach how to design human-computer interaction (HCI) - whether its a mobile app, a web client, an Arduino-based IoT application, a robot or, as students do in the project, an artificial intelligence. The course focus on the role that users play when designing technology for them and with them. How can students understand what people need and how can students get inspired by what people dream about? How can students translate those needs and dreams into novel technology concepts and improve existing products and services? How can students design user experience? In this class, students understand design not only as a means to create beautiful surfaces but also as an approach that helps students create solutions that people value and enjoy. This class includes project work, in which is applied everything that has been learned to research and solve real-world problems using HCI design methods. Specifically, students address the topic of the student design challenge of CHI 2018, the worldâ€™s leading research conference on HCI. In addition to what is defined by the challenge, course focus on solutions that use the power of artificial intelligence.
