* **Course name:** Database Systems
* **Course number:** XYZ
* **Subject area:** Computer science


Course characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* How databases are implemented in practice
* What optimization are performed to ensure high performance of DBMS


### What is the purpose of this course?


While courses like Introduction to Software Engineering cover the core concepts behind database design and the relational model, there are further considerations that should be addressed to pursue a career in this field. This course focuses on both software design, under the form of conceptual and logical DB design, and physical optimization, and will introduce concept such us concurrency and NoSQL databases. More attention will be given to the functioning of Database Management Systems (DBMs), looking at the internal implementation details..



### Course Objectives Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


* How to design, develop and implement a mid-scale relational database for an application domain using a relational DBMS ,
* How DBMSes support different physical database design, implementation, and optimization issues,
* How datafiles and index files are stored and organized,
* How to use persistence’s tools in the context of modern software architectures and the Cloud.


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


* Understand physical database design, implementation, and optimization issues,
* Understand how datafiles and index files are stored and organized,
* Understand how to use persistence’s tools in the context of modern software architectures and the Cloud.


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


* Manage SQL and Non-SQL databases.
