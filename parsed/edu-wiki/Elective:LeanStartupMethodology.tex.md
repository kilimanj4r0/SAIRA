Lean Start-up Methodology
=========================


This is an introductory course to the Start-up Development Process not only for those who plan to start their own companies but also for those who plan to work as a team lead or product manager in a company or the governmental organization. Starting from basics the course guides students on how to start a project from scratch, develop a customer base, validate hypothesis and scale up. Course introduces students to the world of business models, lean start-up methodology, customer development, key metrics, team management, investor relationships, competitive analysis and tactics to find a blue ocean. One of the main reasons why startups and projects fail is incapability of founders to find the real pain of customers and choose the right market. By completing this course students learn how to provide a solution for the market, how start-up is working and how it’s different from the classic business. Acquired skills help to come up with the execution plan for the own future start-up and in the meantime help to commit to the corporate’s business as an entrepreneur in house.
