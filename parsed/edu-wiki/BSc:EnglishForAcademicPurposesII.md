### Late Submission Policy


This policy will be strictly applied in this course. If a personal emergency should arise that affects your ability to turn in an assignment in a timely fashion, you must contact the course instructor BEFORE the deadline to get a “Special Late Submission Approval” from the course instructor. Documents that prove the urgency of your situation must be submitted to your instructor, e.g., health reports. Without the “Special Late Submission Approval”, submissions will be still accepted up to 48 hours late, but with a 25% penalty. No “Special Late Submission Approval” will be granted after the deadline. All late submissions should be submitted via LMS.



### Cooperation Policy and Quotations


We encourage vigorous discussion and cooperation in this class. You should feel free to discuss any aspects of the class with any classmates. However, we insist that any written material that is not specifically designated as a team deliverable needs to be done by you alone. This includes answers to reading questions, individual reports associated with assignments, and labs. We also insist that if you include verbatim text from any source, you clearly indicate it using standard conventions of quotation or indentation and a note to indicate the source.

### Assessment Task (6): Debate


#### Type:


Group work (three members per team)



#### Duration:


15 minutes



#### Rationale:


This task will prepare you to develop and support your points of view in formal debates with strong and valid research-based evidence. What is more, you will get training in using debate vocabulary and rhetorical devices to present your resolution on a specified topic, to defend it, and to convince the audience.



#### Instructions:


You will choose a debate topic and form two teams – an affirmative (proposition) team and a negative (opposition) team. Each team will consist of 3 students. Each student will have to prepare a 1-minute speech presenting a well-grounded pro or con argument. Each team will then have 3 minutes to rebut all the arguments presented by the other team and to defend your team’s resolution. During the rebuttal, each team member has a 1-minute speaking limit. If a speaker exceeds their 1-minute speaking limit, they will remain silent during the rest of the rebuttal. When speaking, you will have to use debate phrases and rhetoric devices as per the vocabulary list provided. During the debate, the audience will be present. The audience will serve as a jury deciding a debate winner. If two thirds of the audience vote for a team, such team wins, and the team gets extra 0.4 added to the assignment 6 grade (those 0.4, weighted accordingly, in some cases will be added to the final course grade score).
