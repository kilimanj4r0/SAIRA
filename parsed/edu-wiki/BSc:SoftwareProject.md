Software Project
================


* **Course name:** Software Project (Fundamentals to Software Engineering from 2021 check another syllabus)
* **Course number:** S20-SP


Course Characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


Scientific foundations for Software Engineering depend on the adequate use of methodologies, techniques, tools, and abstractions for developing software. This course explores fundamental techniques for producing, deploying and analyzing software systems from the Agile philosophy perspective.



### What is the purpose of this course?


The main objectives of this course are the following:



* To understand agile models of interaction design, development, and project management and put those concepts in practice in real software development.
* To get acquainted with processes, technologies, and activities involved eliciting, analyzing, validating, specifying, and managing functional and non-functional requirements of software systems.
* To manage risks and decisions making based on the risk management
* To be able design software, and to write code that sticks to good practices of cohesion, coupling, modularity, reusing, and encapsulation.
* To get familiar with standard reliability techniques such as validation (testing) and verification.
* To gain practical experience with refactoring techniques to improve the quality of existing code.


### Course objectives based on Bloom’s taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* recall Agile manifesto and principles
* recognize different Agile frameworks
* define core principles and rituals of Scrum framework
* list different types of product backlog items
* recall main concept of system testing, VCM, software architecture, technical debt


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* discus pros can cons of different project management tools
* describe criteria for good product backlog
* describe criteria for efficient user stories
* explain how to conduct iteration planing, review and retrospective
* discuss possible strategy of Agile implementation


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* elicit requirements and work with requirements
* design, implement, verify and maintain efficient systems
* present work in front of stakeholders
* effectively critiquing the work of others and receiving such criticism
* work in a development team and collaborate between different teams


### Course evaluation




Course grade breakdown
|  |  | **Proposed points** |

 | 10
 |


**Group work includes:**



* **Sprint Delivery.** This course is organized around developing the program in four 2-weeks iterations (including final delivery). The delivery mostly focuses on the presented works that were done (User stories that were finished during the sprit).
* **Artifacts delivery.** During course, besides code delivery students will create eight artifacts (stakeholder interview report, project management tools analysis report, impact mapping, initial project backlog, a definition of done checklist, user stories acceptance criteria, risk breakdown structure, list of quality attribute scenarios) and should follow and update them.
* **Critique Report Delivery.** Students will have an opportunity to evaluate sprints and artifacts delivery of other teams and provide five critique reports that will emphasize what was done well and what needs to improve.
* **Critique Report Reflection.** Students will have an opportunity to update work that was done based on the critique reports from other team and teacher assistant comments and provide critique report reflection that explains changes.


**Individual work includes:**



* **Peer review report.** At the end of the course, students will sum up the contribution of the work and provide a review of the teammates. The evaluation will be based on the quality of the report (1%) creation and teammates reflection (4%).
* **Participation, presentation delivery.** Students that take participation during lecture and labs classes as well as performing during the presentation will get from 1 to 10% of the grade based on the instructor and lector’s judgment.
* **Attendance.** It is mandatory to participate in the lectures, labs, and presentations (even if not presenting). Presence on all classes will give 5% to the final grade
* **Optional.** Final grades may be adjusted up to 2% taking into account factors like personal students’ effort, improvements during course, and extra credit problems. This additional 2% is only based on the instructor’s personal judgment, and it’s not subject to further clarification.


**Test.**



* After the end of the first part of the course (4 weeks), there will be a test that covers all theoretical and practical material that was presented.

### Typical tasks and exercises for ongoing performance evaluation within this section


Given what was discussed in class regarding how people conceptualize their experiences, design an interview script and conduct the interview with a relevant stakeholder for your class project.



1. First, discuss your class project with a stakeholder. With your target stakeholder in mind, design an interview script with closed- and open-ended questions that cover the professional background or knowledge. The questions should also explore in- depth how that person conducts their business in the problem space.
2. Second, prepare to conduct the interview. Plan for 15 minutes and record the interview using an audio recorder. Take brief notes as you go, recognizing that you have the audio recording to complement your notes.
3. Third, transcribe 1-page of information from your interview that describes the most relevant events to your project. This should include the user’s goals and any explanation of how and why they pursue those goals.
