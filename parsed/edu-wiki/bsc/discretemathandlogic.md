Course outline
--------------


The course is designed for Software Engineering and Computer Science students to teach them basic reasoning and proving skills and provide them by a correct knowledge of basic (core) concepts, definitions, theoretical results and elementary applied methods & techniques of the set theory, algebra of relations and functions, finite combinatorics and discrete probability, graph theory, , discrete optimization and dynamic programming, lattice theory and Boolean algebras, Boolean logic and propositional calculus, propositional modelling and satisfiability. All definitions and theorem statements (that will be given in lectures and that are needed to explain the keywords listed above) will be formally stated, but just few of them will be formally proven. Instead (in practice classes) we will try these definitions and theorems on work with routine exercises and a little bit more complicated (complex) problems. The course is based on a textbook “Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications” by K.H. Rosen and a non-conventional textbook “Concrete Mathematics” by R.L. Graham, D.E. Knuth and O. Patashnik (specially designed as a mathematical complement for “The Art of Computer Programming”).



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


The course will provide an opportunity for participants to:



* know elements and basics of set theory, theory of relations and functions, enumerating Combinatorics, graph theory, discrete optimization and propositional logic and reasoning ;
* understand role of set theory in foundations of mathematics and role of discrete mathematics for foundations of programming and modeling of discrete system ;
* get practical experience with basic algorithms in discrete mathematics and propositional logic.


Programming related learning outcomes
