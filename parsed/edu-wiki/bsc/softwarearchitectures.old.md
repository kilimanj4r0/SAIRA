Course outline
--------------


Software developers often follow architectural and design patterns informally without a deep understanding of the subject. This prevents the delivered software to work optimally and often to meet functional and nonfunctional requirements. The course provides a detailed understanding of software architectures and design pattern and how they should be used by software developers and in the software engineering process.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


* Understand the principles and foundations of software architectures
* Understanding design patterns and their use
* Develop high quality software meeting requirements
* Realizing how architectural issues can impact software design
* Understanding formal notations and specifications with related tools


Expected acquired core competences
----------------------------------


* System design
* Requirements elicitation
* Organization of software systems
* Use of design patterns
* Fluency with formal notations and supporting tools
