(a) What is the period of the oscillation? (b) Use the law of conservation of energy to determine the maximum distance the block moves both above and below the point at which the spring is unstretched. (These are not necessarily the same.) (c) What is the amplitude of the oscillation? (d) What is the maximum kinetic energy of the block as it oscillates?
