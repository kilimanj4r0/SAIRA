Probability and Statistics
==========================


* **Course name**: Probability and Statistics
* **Code discipline**: CSE206
* **Subject area**: Math


Short Description
-----------------


The course is designed to provide Software Engineers and Computer Scientists by correct knowledge of basic (core) concepts, definitions, theoretical results and applied methods & techniques of Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics. The main idea of the course is to study mathematical basis of modelling random experiments. The course includes constructing a probability space, a model of a random experiment, and its applications to practice. After that, random variables and their properties are considered. As examples of applying this theoretical background, limit theorems of probability theory are proved (law of large numbers, central limit theorem) and some elements of mathematical statistics are studied.

2. One of 10-digit numbers in which digits go in non-increasing order is chosen at random. Find the probability that exactly 4 different digits are used in this number.
3. Two persons play a game. They take turns in rolling a 10-sided fair die. The first one wins as soon as he rolls 9 or 10, whereas the second one wins as soon as he gets no more than 4. (The game goes on until one of the player’s winning conditions is met). Determine the probability for the first player to win the game.

5. There are 5 white balls and 7 green balls in the first urn; 2 white balls and 10 green balls in the second urn. The third urn, that has initially been empty, is filled with the balls: 4 balls are taken from the first urn, 6 balls are taken from the second urn, and they are placed into the third urn. After that, 2 balls are taken at random from the third urn. It turns out that both these balls are green. Determine the probability that these balls originate from different urns.

5. Prove that for multivariate normal distribution uncorrelatedness implies independence.

### The retake exam


Retakes will be run as a comprehensive exam, where the student will be assessed the acquired knowledge coming from the textbooks, the lectures, the labs, and the additional required reading material, as supplied by the instructor. During such comprehensive oral/written the student could be asked to solve exercises and to explain theoretical and practical aspects of the course.
