Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


This course covers the system and network administration for GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems. The students with the minor of security and blockchain must be able to operate GNU/Linux as their main server-oriented system and perform different tasks such as setting up and operating various tools and daemons. This is a very essential course for the security expert which will give the students hands-on experience of system deployment, firmware, booting, partitions, volume management, system and network optimization. At the end of this course, the students will be equipped with the tools and skills that they can use in industrial production environments. This course is practice-oriented similarly to a certification training. After completion, the students could be entitled as (junior) system and network analysts.



### ILOs defined at three levels

* Principles of the Unix culture
* Linux bonding modes and link aggregation
* CA vs intermediate vs leaf SSL certificates
* High Availability cluster architecture
* Load-balancing cluster architecture
* Virtualization architecture
* Distributed storage architecture
* Convergence and hyper-convergence


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* In-depth operational knowledge of GNU/Linux and system daemons
* How GIT differs from CVS
* How rather critical IT infrastructures are handled
* Difference between caching DNS forwarder and an authoritative DNS service
* Requirements and use-cases for High Availability
* Requirements and use-cases for load-balancing
* Requirements and use-cases for virtualization
* Requirements and use-cases for distributed storage
* Challenges & constraints with convergence and hyper-convergence
* Requirements to automate the deployments of several servers at once


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* System & daemons troubleshooting - read the logs
* Install a GNU/Linux system and configure it for it to be used a server
* Fix the boot-loader or recover the root account
* Use Version Control Systems
* Build software daemons from source
* Build the Linux kernel from source
* Design the architecture of IT infrastructures
* Deploy and maintain IT infrastructures
* Network troubleshooting - check for open ports
* Setting up network link aggregations
* Securing SSL web browser sessions
* SSL cipher suites tuning
* Bootstrap guest machines from the host
* Deal with RAW and QCOW2 sparse files
* Evaluate the need for network disks (block devices)
* Evaluate the need for network file-systems versus shared-disk file-systems
