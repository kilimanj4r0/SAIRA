Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


Game Theory is a powerful method to make predictive decisions about common business cases and acts as a foundational course to decision making in AI systems, such as Bayesian techniques and game trees and Monte Carlo Tree Search. As such the purpose of this course is to provide a solid foundation on the basic structures of mathematical games including the canonical 2 by 2 structures of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, Chicken, Hawk and Dove, and Battle of the Sexes. Then looks at more complicated business examples such as price setting, making creditable threats and promises. It also gives practical instruction on the application of computers in game playing, especially tournament play and development of decision making models.

### Final assessment


**Section 1**



1. List and example the set of externalities of PD
2. Worked examples of Nash Equilibrium and Domination
3. Given the payoff matrix for a given game, what is the outcome of play.
4. A button is put before you. If you don’t press the button you get a low passing grade on this question. If you press the button and less than half the class presses the button you get a high passing grade for this question. If more than half the class presses the button then those who press the button get a failing grade for this question. Do you press the button?


**Section 2**



1. Simulate the IPD, does the ESS occur?
2. When the time-line of an ESS is extended but we include the restriction of a finite space, what happens to the equilibriumum
3. Demonstrate the Best Response method on an example matrix


**Section 3**



1. Show a working finite state machine IPD model of Trifecta.
2. Create a Tournament agent to compete against your classmates for a given game.
3. Given a set of players for a IPD model, what is the most likely equilibrium outcome, explain.
