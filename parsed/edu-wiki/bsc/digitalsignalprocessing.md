Course outline
--------------


The goal of the course is to present rigorous mathematical foundations of signal processing tools using intuitive geometric point of view. The course is designed to provide basic mathematic knowledge needed for further studies of applied signal processing and digital signal processing from engineering as well as from mathematical perspective.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


The course will provide an opportunity for participants to:



* know basics of the mathematical theory of
	+ Discrete-time Fourier Transformation (DTFT),
	+ Discrete Fourier Transformation (DTFT),
	+ Fast Discrete Fourier Transformation (FDFT),
	+ Fourie series;
* understand relations between
	+ analog and digital signals,
	+ continuous and discrete signals,
	+ discrete signals and their convolution,
	+ discrete systems and filters,
	+ impulse and frequency domains;
* get practical experience with mathematical package SciLab/Octave in digital signal processing.


Programming related learning outcomes
-------------------------------------


Course includes 6 programming laboratory assignments:



1. Basics of Octave: realize computation algorithms.
2. DSP for audio signals: echo generation/cancellation, auto-correlation.
3. Convolution reverb and room impulse response.
4. DFT/FFT implementation, verification of the Convolution theorem.
5. Developing spectrogram function from scratch.
6. Fourier series approximation, Gibbs phenomenon.


Special attention will be paid for the quality and the OO-style of the implementation.
