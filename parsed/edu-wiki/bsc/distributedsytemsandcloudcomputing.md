* **Course number:** X


Course Characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Principles of designing and implementing distributed systems
* Structure of distributed system, and algorithms used to implement distributed system


### What is the purpose of this course?


This is an introductory course in distributed systems. During the course, students will learn the fundamental principles and techniques that can be applied to design and develop distributed systems, and will cover architectures of distributed systems, communication, naming, fault tolerance, consistency replication, virtualization and security. In addition, we will discuss different aspects of design and implementation of popular distributed systems (such as bittorrent, google file system, HDFS, etc.), programming models (MapReduce, MapReduce2/YARN) and consensus algorithms (Raft and Paxos). The course will not only cover computer science related topics, but will also include a substantial part of software engineering activities.
