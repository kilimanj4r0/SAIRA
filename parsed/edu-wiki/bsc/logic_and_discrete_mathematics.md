Logic and Discrete Mathematics (Philosophy 1)
=============================================


* **Course name:** Logic and Discrete Mathematics (Philosophy 1)
* **Course number:** CSE113
* **Subject area:** n/a


Course characteristics
----------------------


This course consists of two distinct but overlapping parts: i. Logic; and ii. Discrete Mathematics.


The first part of the course is an introduction to formal symbolic logic. Philosopher John Locke once wrote that ``logic is the anatomy of thought. *This part of the course will teach* 
students to analyse and evaluate arguments using the formal techniques of modern symbolic logic.


The second part of the is designed for students to teach them basic notions of graph theory, discrete optimization and dynamic programming. This part will give practical experience with basic algorithms in discrete mathematics. 



### Key concepts of the class


* Deductive Reasoning
* Inductive Reasoning
* Categorical Logic
* Propositional Logic
* Predicate Logic
* Basic elements of Graph Theory
* Planar Graphs
* Algorithms on Graphs


### What is the purpose of this course?


The first part of the course (on Logic) sets students upon a path of finely honed logical skills essential for life in the modern world. This part of the course is thus specifically designed to improve writing, thinking and oral presentation skills that are applicable to all areas of academic study and relevant to working life.


The Discrete Math part of the course introduces students to the basic concepts of structuring algorithms through graph theory. This gives students the skills of deep algorithmic thinking. Thus, the successful completion of the course by students will give them the skills for further deep mastering of computer science courses.

### What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to understand:



* what is categorical logic
* what is propositional logic
* what is predicate logic
* what is the difference between deduction and induction
* what is trees and spanning trees
* what is Euler and Hamilton graphs
* what is planar graphs
* Dijkstra’s algorithm


### What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to apply the content of this course in all areas of their academic study but also in their working life, with special reference to the following disciplines:



* computer science
* engineering
* robotics


### Course evaluation

If necessary, please indicate freely your course’s features in terms of students’ performance assessment.



### Final Exam (Written, Math):


The final exam will consist of theoretical and practical questions. The exam will be 90 minutes long.



### Mid Term (Written, Logic):


The midterm exam will consist of quizzes and various exercises (such as open theoretical questions, multiple choices, and true/false questions). The Mid-Term will be held in class on week 8. The exam will last 75 minutes.



### Participation/Attendance:


Weekly exercises (hereby reports) must be uploaded on moodle the day after the lab sessions are over. Although reports are not marked, they directly count towards participation. Failure to submit reports will incur in a penalty of the course mark, which will be proportional to the number of reports missing.


**Overall score:** 100 points (100%).



### Grades range




Course grading range
|  |  | **Proposed range** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A. Excellent
 | 85-100

| C. Satisfactory
 | 60-75
 | 60-75
 |
| D. Poor
 | 0-59
 | 0-59

If necessary, please indicate freely your course’s grading features: The semester starts with the default range as proposed, but it may change slightly (usually reduced) depending on how the semester progresses.

Electronic copies of these books will be available on Moodle for download. All the materials for the course will be uploaded by the Professors on Moodle in due time. Please note: The lectures will be highly interactive and the students may be interrogated during the lectures, sometimes via kahoots (this approach is known as flipped learning).
