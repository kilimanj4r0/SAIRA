Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
=======================================


* **Course name:** Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
* **Course number:** ?????


Course Characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Artificial Intelligence: Introduction to the ethical use of AI and the framework of development of AI systems
* Artificial Intelligence: Evolutionary Algorithms


### What is the purpose of this course?


Have you ever wondered about how computers decide on what your credit worthiness is, or how they can play chess as good as a world master, or how world class circuits can be built with a minimal number of crossed wires? Perhaps you have wanted to build a human like robot, or have wanted to explore the stars with automated probes. Artificial Intelligence is the field which examines such problems. The goal is to provide a diverse theoretical overview of historical and current thought in the realm of Artificial Intelligence, Computational Intelligence, Robotics and Machine Learning Techniques.



Course Objectives Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy
-------------------------------------------


#### What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to



* Gather an appreciation of the history of AI founders
* Solve simple problems using random, guided, and directed, search methods and be able to compare their abilities to solve the problem using a statistical argument


#### What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


* Understand the PEAS model of problem definition
* Understand the Environment Model
* Understand the role of AI within computer science in a variety of fields and applications


#### What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


* Apply Evolutionary Algorithms to a number of problems
* Apply the PEAS model of problem definition
* Apply the apply the Environment Model

Course grade breakdown
| Type | Points
 |
| --- | --- |

This course has a required class element of practical work on course elements, the retake is not a substitute for practical knowledge, and it is inherently unfair that students who have not submitted these practical elements are graded the same as those who have accomplished course materials. In order to be eligible for the retake, a student is required to have submitted all course assignments, and have a passing grade on those elements. The lacking/failing elements, can be presented for this purpose up to 3 business days before the retake for evaluation. In the case of the resubmission of a failing element, a document should be attached noting which changes have been made to the assignment in order to lead to a passing mark. Lack of these elements in a passing state presented to the committee will be considered a failing grade for the retake.


The retake grade will count as the final course grade, with the first retake giving no more than a B as final grade, and the second retake giving no more than a C. The first retake will be a written exam submitted to the professor, and the second retake as an oral commission.



### Grades range

### Typical questions for ongoing performance evaluation within this section


1. State and apply the PEAS model to a set of problems.
2. State the difference between Plato and Aristotle’s conceptions of knowledge - refer to Socrates definition?

### Typical questions for seminar classes (labs) within this section


1. Apply the PEAS model as a group to a real world instance.
2. Discuss - Humans in many low skilled tasks are being replaced by automation, what role do practitioners have in protecting its abuse
3. Discuss - Asimov’s laws of robotics are used as a science fiction application of ethics in AI, do you think they have a role in the real world.
4. Discuss - how can we prevent bias from entering into systems.
5. Discuss - What does it mean for a Computer to be Creative?


### Test questions for final assessment in this section
