PHIL-Introduction to Logic
==========================


* **Course name:** Philosophy 1 - Introduction to Logic
* **Course number:** XYZ


Course Characteristics
----------------------


This course is an introduction to formal symbolic logic. Philosopher John Locke once wrote that “logic is the anatomy of thought.” This course will teach students to analyse and evaluate arguments using the formal techniques of modern symbolic logic.



### Key concepts of the class


* Deductive Reasoning
* Inductive Reasoning
* Abductive Reasoning
* Principles of Argumentation
* Logical Fallacies
* Propositional Logic
* Predicate Logic


### What is the purpose of this course?


This course sets students upon a path of finely honed logical skills essential for life in the modern world. This course is thus specifically designed to improve writing, thinking and oral presentation skills that are applicable to all areas of academic study and relevant to working life.



### Course objectives based on Bloom’s taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to know the basics of Logic Reasoning. In particular, they should be able to remember:



* what is an argument
* how to construct and reconstruct arguments
* how to use the square of opposition and Venn diagrams
* how to calculate truth values
* the formal structures of some arguments
* how to evaluate arguments critically
* the difference between deduction, induction, and abduction
* how to recognize and avoid logical mistakes and fallacies in arguments


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to understand:



* what is categorical logic
* what is propositional logic
* what is predicate logic
* what is the difference between deduction, induction, and abduction


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to apply the content of this course in all areas of their academic study but also in their working life, with special reference to the following disciplines:



* computer science
* engineering
* robotics

| Final Exam (Oral)
 | 40

| MidTerm

#### Final Exam (Oral)


The final exam will consist of an oral interrogation conducted by the Professor. Students will be questioned in deep on the content of the course and will be assessed for being able to present with accuracy what was presented, for showing their own ability to reflect on it, and apply the presented concepts in a variety of situations.



#### Video Presentations:


Video Presentations are to be done in groups defined by the instructor at his discretion, with a max duration of 5 minutes (300 seconds). Groups from 4 to 7 students should be proposed to the instructor by week 2 of the course; the instructor will then review them and finalize them by week 4. Notice, that even this is a group work, the contribution of each member of the group should be crystal clear and any attempt of skipping this component of the exam will trigger a D in the course. Video presentations can be done on logical fallacies, materials for self-study and preparation will be posted on Moodle by the Professor.



#### MidTerm Exam:


This exam will consist of quizzes and various exercises (such as open theoretical questions, multiple choices, and true/false questions). The Mid-Term will be held in class on week 8. The exam will last 75 minutes.



#### Attendance/Participation


Weekly exercises (hereby reports) must be submitted to the instructor the day after the lab sessions are over. Although reports are not marked, they directly count towards participation. Failure to submit reports will incur in a penalty of your final mark which will be proportional to the number of reports missing.

Electronic copies of these books are available on Moodle for download. Students must read and carefully study the mandatory readings (mostly weekly slides, handouts or relevant papers) ahead of each lecture. The materials for the course will be uploaded by the Professor on Moodle in due time. Please note: The lectures will be highly interactive and the students will be interrogated on the readings during the lectures, sometimes via kahoots (this approach is known as flipped learning).
