Introduction to Optimization
============================


* **Course name**: Introduction to Optimization
* **Code discipline**: CSE???

Short Description
-----------------


The course outlines the classification and mathematical foundations of optimization methods, and presents algorithms for solving linear and nonlinear optimization.
The purpose of the course is to introduce students to methods of linear and convex optimization and their application in solving problems of linear, network, integer, and nonlinear optimization.

Formative Assessment and Course Activities
------------------------------------------


### Ongoing performance assessment


#### Section 1


1. A steel company must decide how to allocate next week’s time on a rolling mill, which is a machine that takes unfinished slabs of steel as input and can produce either of two semi-finished products: bands and coils. The mill’s two products come off the rolling line at different rates:
Bands 200 tons/hr
Coils 140 tons/hr.
They also produce different profits:
Bands $ 25/ton
Coils $ 30/ton.
Based on currently booked orders, the following upper bounds are placed on the amount of each product to produce:
Bands 6000 tons
Coils 4000 tons.
Given that there are 40 hours of production time available this week, the problem is to decide how many tons of bands and how many tons of coils should be produced to yield the greatest profit. Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem. Can you solve this problem by inspection?
2. Solve the following linear programming problems.
maximize

### The retake exam


Retakes will be run as a comprehensive exam, where the student will be assessed the acquired knowledge coming from the textbooks, the lectures, the labs, and the additional required reading material, as supplied by the instructor. During such comprehensive oral/written the student could be asked to solve exercises and to explain theoretical and practical aspects of the course.
