Software Quality, Reliability and Security
==========================================


* **Course name**: Software Quality, Reliability and Security
* **Code discipline**:
* **Subject area**: Computer Science Fundamentals


Short Description
-----------------


Building high-quality software is utmost important. However, it is easier said than done. The course is an overview of software quality and software reliability engineering methods. It includes introduction to software quality, overview of static analysis methods, testing techniques and reliability engineering. The students will put in practice the methods during laboratory classes and will dig down the topics in a small realistic project. The course promotes the quality analysis automation, which is a “must-know” in the modern software development practice. Therefore, the theoretical material taught at lectures will be accompanied by the continuous integration practice with regards the quality analysis methods to be demonstrated at labs. The course balances traditional lectures, laboratory class and a small course project in which students apply the concepts and methods they learn to real artifacts. The course project consists in a quality analysis of an open source project(s). The final evaluation is done at the Quality In Use hackathon that brings challenges from the industry on evaluation of open source software components.

### The retake exam


**Section 1**



1. The retake takes the form of an oral exam based on the material taught in class as well as an individual project that follows the lab's material. is project-based as well. Students need to demonstrate understanding of the course material and apply what they learned in an individual prototype project. The grading criteria for each section are the same as for the final project presentation. There has to be a meeting before the retake itself to plan and agree on the project ideas, and to answer questions.
