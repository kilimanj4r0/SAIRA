Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


This course exposes the student to the core concepts behind Lean Development in Software Engineering, beyond myths and legends, emphasizing how it relates to the general principles of Lean Development. It discusses the different possible software processes, how they can be tailored, enacted, and measured. In addition, a significant part of the course is centered around the application of lean to software development to knowledge intensive areas not necessarily connected to software.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?

* creative nature of software production as an act of creativity of the human mind,
* the substantial differences between tame and wicked problems,
* the core concepts of measurement in software engineering,
* the fundamentals of Taylorist/Fordist approaches to (software) production,
* the basis of lean and agile software development,
* the “dark” side of agility,
* the importance of knowledge and knowledge sharing in producing software,
* how to create an ad-hoc process for a development organization.


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* when a problem is “easy to solve” provided enough effort is put to such solution and when it is not,
* what is a measure in general,
* why it is important and how we can define and perform measurements in software engineering, especially in lean and agile development environments,
* how to organize the development process to collect metrics non invasively,
* the difference between pulling and pushing in (software) development,
* the fundamental principle of agility,
* the risk intrinsic in the dark side of agile,
* how to organize an agile development process based on the definition of overall Goals, associated Question, and milestones based on Metrics,
* an environment based on experience, like the Experience Factory.


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Compute the fundamental software metrics to track the evolution of a project,
* Organize the aims of a (software) development organization in terms of Goals, Questions, and Metrics,
* Create a tailored (lean and agile) development process for an organization producing software,
* Define a path to insert and manage such (lean and agile) development process into an organization producing software,
* Structure the experience gathering during inside an organization to based on it the future strategic decision of such organization,
* Relate the various proposals for Agile Methods to the overall principles of Lean Management,
* Define a suitable (lean) process for a new organization, a process to introduce and institutionalize it, and an approach to measure the outcome of such introduction and institutionalization.

 |
| --- | --- |
| Class and lab participation (including class quizzes) | 20
 |
| Project | 40
 |
| Oral Exam | 40
 |


Each activity is mandatory and failing any component of the course implies failing the entire course and go to the retake, apart from the students declaring at the beginning of the course that they aim for a C, in which case the rule below applies.


Students will be asked to define their learning goals at the beginning of the course and will have a personalized evaluation framework. In particular:



* Students aiming for a C can focus on attending lectures and having a pre-oral at the end of week 2, passing which they can achieve their goal, provided that they actively attend and participate at all lectures, including the final presentations;
* Students aiming for a B and A in addition to attending lecture and labs, sustaining an oral, also need to have a project with a clear output as written below, including a report and a presentation at the end.


### Recommendations for students on how to succeed in the course


The goal of the project is to read the book and understand what is the takeaway for software engineering, considering three fundamental aspects: a) the process to follow, b) the product being built c) the structure of the team and its organization. The projects will be executed in weekly iteration on traceable files.


The projects will be partially graded weekly (30%) and part at the end (70%). Moreover, at the end you will need to give a 5-minute presentation of your work.


During the first week of the project you will create the overall GQM of the project and you will be evaluated based on it during the second week. During the second week of the project you will also create the vision of your project with a roadmap. From the third week onward you will start to have the reviews of your project increments in terms of the a) progresses toward the completion b) accurate planning based on the defined GQM, and c) quality of the work. Weekly grade ranges from 0 to 2 points.


The overall project success will be evaluated as following:

**Section 3**



1. What aspects of making software feel like an art, which like a craft to you and how could you bend Taylorism and Fordism to handle it?
2. How does Fordism and Taylorism can explain that companies producing software containing bugs can still stay in the market, and, in certain case, also be successful?
3. Based on your experience and previous courses, which development models can refer to Fordism and Taylorism and which cannot be reduced to it?
4. How does the specialization of work in software development can be linked to Fordism and Taylorism?
5. Provide an example for each of the fundamental activities of managers according to Taylor that shows how such activity is very useful in software development and one that shows that is is inadequate.


**Section 4**



1. Structure a model like PDSA for a company producing websites for online marketing.
2. How can the right part and the right information be always available without waste according to the Toyota approach?
3. Compare a street crossing based on traffic lights with a roundabout and determine the approach that is safest and the one with the a highest throughput according to Waterfall and to Lean.
4. Discuss the involvements of workers in tayloristic/fordistic and in Lean development processes and their implications for the retention and the improvement of the quality of the workforce.
5. Outline the extent of which economies of scale exist in Lean development processes.
6. Imagine you had to introduce Extreme Programming in a software development team that follows a waterfall process. Which problems do you foresee? How will the clients react (that until now are used to work with a team that used the waterfall process)? How would you address them?


**Section 5**



1. Imagine you are the boss of a small software development company. Which actions would you do or which practices would you introduce to prevent that your programmers fall into the trap of following a software guru?
2. Elaborate possible extreme (and damaging) positions that can be taken by gurus of agile.
3. Explain the differences in introducing a methodology by a guru and by a smart and effective coach.
4. Detail why Extreme Programming produces an informative workspace.
5. Discuss effective ways of packaging and “distributing” knowledge in software teams, starting with the guru approach of organizing knowledge into simple, clear practices which are easy to explain and to follow.


**Section 6**



1. Discuss the role of customer on-site under the perspective of lean and outline it relevance in the earlier and then in the later proposals of agile software development.
2. Suppose that you have to develop Balanced Scorecards for a software development team. Which perspectives would you use? Which goals would you use for each perspective?
3. What is a socio-technical system and how can it be used to describe an (agile) software production environement?
4. Imagine you want to evaluate how readable the source code of some program is. Define a GQM+ model to describe what and why you would measure.
5. The development in company M occurs according to the following schema: when a new project is started, a developer takes an old project that is the most similar to the new requirements and makes a copy and starts implementing the required modifications. To improve this process and to help the company to adopt a component-based approach, we want to understand which pieces of code are the best candidates for future components and which variability points they have. Define a suitable GQM+ for such purpose.


**Section 7**



1. What type of wisdom (in the sense of “know-why”) would you manage in an Experience Factory to support Lean Thinking? Distinguish between organizational learning and project learning.
2. Assume you are a manager convinced that Theory X is true. Which non-invasive measurement probes would you want to develop to maximize productivity? Now assume you are convinced that Theory Y is true. Which non-invasive measurement probes would you need now?
3. We discussed that we foresee two ways to collect measurements non- invasively: in batch and in background mode. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
4. There are many interrelated building blocks (or concepts) of Lean Software Development and each contributes differently to it. What types of data are handled by each of these building blocks (or concepts)? How do the contribution to the overall value stream, to the creation of knowledge, and to the overall improvement?
5. Assume you set up a fantastic dashboard for your team. As you collect the data and visualize it, you notice that all the measurements show problematic values. You let the dashboard in place for some days and also show it to your collaborators, but nobody cares; everybody continues his job as if everything would be fine. What is going wrong?
