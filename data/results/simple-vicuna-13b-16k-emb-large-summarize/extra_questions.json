    "question": "What are the Eligibility criteria for Exchange programs?",
    "answer": "**Semesters available for exchange:** - Bachelor's level: 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 - Master's level: 2 or 3\n\n**Trimesters available for exchange:** - Bachelor's level: 4, 5, 7, 8\n\n**GPA required:** - regular exchange: 4.0 or higher - Erasmus+: 4.4 or higher.\n\nYou should also check the entry requirements of the partner university at its website.",
    "generated_answer": "To determine eligibility criteria for exchange programs at Innopolis University, we can infer the following based on the provided context:\n\n1. Academic background: Students with \"A\" or \"B\" grades from their previous two semesters may be eligible for exchange programs. This requirement is similar to those for transfer students (point 3 in the Transfer Students section).\n2. Extracurricular achievements: Having extracurricular achievements in research, social, sport, cultural, or arts fields can potentially make a student more competitive for an exchange program. This requirement is also similar to the one for transfer students (point 3 in the Transfer Students section).\n3. Special circumstances: If a student has special circumstances that they believe qualify them for an exchange program, they should consult with their university's Student Affairs department or the organization responsible for managing the exchange program to clarify their eligibility. This is similar to the advice given in the context for transfer students (point 3 in the Transfer Students section).\n\nIn summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention eligibility criteria for exchange programs, it can be inferred that academic background and extracurricular achievements may play a role. Additionally, special circumstances could potentially be taken into account during the application process."
