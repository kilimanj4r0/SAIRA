    "question": "Can I have a pet in the dormitory?",
    "answer": "No, pets are not allowed in the dormitory. The dormitory rules explicitly state that pets are prohibited within the premises.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find relevant information from the context and use common sense. Here are the steps:\n\n- First, we look for any mention of pets in the dormitory rules. We find that pets are not allowed on the territory of the campus. This implies that having a pet in the dormitory is against the rules and could result in disciplinary sanctions.\n- Second, we consider if there are any exceptions or special cases for having a pet in the dormitory. We do not find any such information in the context. Therefore, we assume that the rule applies to all students and does not allow for any exemptions.\n- Third, we use common sense to think about the reasons why pets are not allowed in the dormitory. We can infer that pets might cause noise, mess, allergy, or safety issues for other students and staff. We can also assume that the university has other facilities or areas where pets are welcome, such as the park or the farm.\n- Based on these steps, we can conclude that having a pet in the dormitory is not allowed and could have negative consequences.\n\n### Final answer: No, you cannot have a pet in the dormitory."
