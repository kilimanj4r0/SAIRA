    "answer": "Hello! Upon your return to Innopolis University, as an international student, promptly upload your migration card and passport scans within three days on My University's \"Migration Card\" section. Then, submit visa details in the \"Visa\" section, followed by uploading your new registration card scan and related information in the \"Registration\" section. Non-compliance incurs a 2000 ruble late fee at Verkhny Uslon's Migration department and potential deportation after two violations. It's crucial to follow these guidelines upon arrival to avoid penalties or deportation.",
    "generated_answer": "\nIt seems that there is no clear answer to this query, as the text appears to be a combination of different information and not directly related to a specific question or answer. It mentions various aspects of migration control for international students, such as uploading documents, obtaining a new registration card, and paying late fees. It also touches upon business trips and exchange opportunities. However, it does not provide a direct answer to the query of what an international student needs to do when they arrive at Innopolis University.\n\nIf you have a more specific question about what an international student should do when they arrive at Innopolis University, I would be happy to try and help you find an answer."
