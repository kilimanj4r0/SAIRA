    "question": "How may I know how long I will need to work for a resident company?",
    "answer": "Answer to this question is given individually. Inbox 319@innopolis.ru, state your name and surname, and await a response from the Resource Centre.",

For example, if you are a recent graduate or have little to no work experience, you may start out at a lower salary level with fewer benefits and less job security, but as you gain more experience and skills, your salary may increase. If you are entering a highly competitive industry, such as technology or finance, you may need to work longer hours or take on additional responsibilities in order to advance in your career. Additionally, if the company is experiencing financial difficulties or facing increased competition, they may be less willing to invest in long-term employee development and may be more likely to let go of employees with less tenure.
