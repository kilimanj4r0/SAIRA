    "generated_answer": "\nBased on the provided documents, it seems that you are looking for information regarding the rules of registration for military service for students at Innopolis State University. Specifically, you want to know what documents are required and how to obtain them. Additionally, you have asked about deferment from military service and the selection criteria for exchange programs. Lastly, you have inquired about administrative responsibilities for offering elective courses at Innopolis State University and whether accommodation can be provided.\n\nThe following is a summary of the information you requested:\n\n**Registration for Military Service:**\n\nTo register for military service, students must first obtain temporary registration from the city council office. To do this, they need to present their passport and residence permit (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430). After obtaining the temporary registration, the student must collect the following documents: a copy of their passport's 1st page and residence permit, the temporary registration, an academic reference, a military service registration certificate, and an application for the military service registration. The last three documents are prepared by the 319 office. Once all the required documents are collected, they should be submitted to the 319 office, which will then submit them to the military commissariat.\n\n**Deferment from Military Service:**\n\nIf a student has a military service card, they do not need to register at Verkhny Uslon on their own. However, if they have been previously registered in Kazan or Zelenodolsk, they do not need to register in the military office of Verkhny Uslon. If a student has received a request for Reference - Appendix 4 from the military office where they were previously registered, they must also order it on my.university, indicating the name of the military office from which this Reference was requested.\n\n**Selection Criteria for Exchange Programs:**\n\nAlternatively, you may contact International Relations Office in room 503A. You can find selection criteria here:  [https://innopolis.ru/en/international-relations/exchange-programs](https://innopolis.ru/en/international-relations/exchange-programs)\n\n**Administrative Responsibilities for Offering Elective Courses:**\n\nIf you are interested in offering elective courses at Innopolis State University, you will need to provide the syllabus of the course and submit it to Viktoria Mostyakova. The syllabus is supposed to be done in both English and Russian. If you don\u2019t speak Russian, we can help you with the translation. Your Moodle page should also be organized with respect to the course syllabus (same sections, activities), it should contain relevant materials (slides, papers, references, lecture notes, repositories, \u2026). All graded activities must be projected to Moodle with assignments, quizzes, and graded items. You should collect attendance and provide final grades in Moodle in 3 days after the final exam.\n\n**Accommodation for Exchange Students:**\n\nThe Faculty Support and Affairs department can arrange accommodation in the university premises that is fully covered by the agreement. For other preferences, please refer to the department."
