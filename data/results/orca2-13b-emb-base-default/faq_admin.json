    "question": "How to order references?",
    "answer": "You can order a reference on MyUniversity by selecting the right type of reference, amount of copies and for whom are you ordering it.",
    "generated_answer": "To order references in APA style, you need to follow some basic rules depending on the type of source you are citing. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n- Order references by the author's last name, from A to Z. If there are multiple works by the same author, order them by publication year, from earliest to latest.\n- If there are no authors, order by the title of the work, using a-z or A-Z, depending on whether it is a book or an article.\n- If there are no authors or titles, use a shortened version of the first few words of the work as the reference.\n- For articles in journals, include the volume and issue number in parentheses after the title, followed by the page numbers in brackets.\n- For books, include the publisher and location in parentheses after the title, followed by the page numbers or a chapter identifier in brackets.\n- Use commas to separate multiple references within each category (book, article, etc.), and use a period to end each reference.\n\nHere is an example of how to order references in APA style:\n\nBrown, D.

    "question": "How long will it take to produce a reference?",
    "answer": "It takes 5 working days to produce a reference from the moment it was ordered on my.university.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer this question, we need to estimate how much time each of the tasks and exercises will require, and then add them up. We can use some heuristics or rules of thumb to approximate the time for each task, such as:\n\n- Updating the product backlog with clarification of user stories: 1 hour per story, assuming we need to consult with the stakeholders and the team, and write down the clarifications.\n- Providing the estimation for the user stories in story points: 15 minutes per story, assuming we use the planning poker technique and have already agreed on the team velocity for iteration 1.\n- Applying the acceptance criteria for every user story: 15 minutes per story, assuming we follow the format and examples that were presented during the lectures.\n- Creating a definition of done checklist for the project: 30 minutes, assuming we have already defined the scope and quality standards for our project, and we need to list the items that must be completed before a user story is considered done.\n- Providing brief justification of statements in the checklist: 15 minutes, assuming we explain the rationale behind each item in the checklist, using bullet points or sentences.\n- Creating slides to present the acceptance criteria and the definition of done: 30 minutes, assuming we use a template and follow the best practices for creating effective presentation slides.\n- Presenting the slides with the sprint 1 deliveries: 10 minutes plus 3 minutes Q&A session, assuming we have prepared our slides well and we can deliver them confidently and clearly.\n\nAdding up these times, we get:\n\n1 + 15 + 15 + 30 + 15 + 30 + 10 + 3 = 129 minutes\n\nHowever, this is a very rough estimate, and it does not account for any possible delays, interruptions, feedback, or revisions that might occur during the process. Therefore, we should add some buffer time to account for these uncertainties, such as:\n\n- 15 minutes for each user story, to allow for some variation in the planning poker technique and the team velocity.\n- 15 minutes for creating the slides, to allow for some changes or improvements based on the feedback from the lectures or the peers.\n- 15 minutes for presenting the slides, to allow for some questions or comments from the stakeholders or the team.\n\nAdding these buffer times to the previous estimate, we get:\n\n1 + 30 + 30 + 45 + 45 + 25 = 240 minutes\n\nTherefore, a possible answer to the question is:\n\n### Final answer: It will take about 240 minutes to produce a reference."

    "question": "If I cannot pick my reference, can somebody else collect it for me?",
    "answer": "Yes. To do this, a student must write a letter of attorney. To collect the reference, a person must present their ID and a letter of attorney.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer this query, we need to understand the meaning of the terms and the conditions that apply. \n\n- A reference is a document or material that supports or confirms some information or claim. For example, a reference for a research paper could be a book, a journal article, or a data set.\n- To pick one's reference means to choose or select a reference that suits one's purpose or need. For example, a student might pick a reference that relates to their topic or argument.\n- To collect one's reference means to obtain or retrieve a reference that is not readily available or accessible. For example, a student might collect a reference from a library, an online database, or another person.\n- A letter of attorney is a legal document that grants permission or authority to someone else to act on behalf of the original owner. For example, a student might give a letter of attorney to another student or staff member to collect their reference for them.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can infer that the query is asking whether another person can collect the reference for the original owner with their consent and authorization. The context information provides an affirmative answer to this question, as long as the owner writes a letter of attorney and the collector presents their ID and the letter of attorney.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the query is:\n\nYes, somebody else can collect your reference for you if you cannot pick it yourself. To do this, you must write a letter of attorney that grants permission to the person who will collect it for you. The person who will collect it for you must present their ID and your letter of attorney to the administrator or staff member who holds your reference"

    "answer": "Answer to this question is given individually. Inbox 319@innopolis.ru, state your name and surname, and await a response from the Resource Centre.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use both the passage and some commonsense knowledge. Here are the steps we can follow:\n\n- First, we need to identify the main topic of the query, which is how long to work for a resident company. A resident company is a company that operates in Innopolis, a smart city in Russia, where foreigners can apply for a digital nomad visa and work remotely. \n- Second, we need to find relevant information from the passage that relates to this topic. The passage states that the answer to this question is given individually, and provides an email address to contact the Resource Centre. This implies that there is no fixed or general rule for how long one has to work for a resident company, but rather it depends on various factors such as the type of work, the visa conditions, the tax regulations, etc. \n- Third, we need to use some commonsense knowledge to infer what these factors might be and why they vary. For example, some types of work may require more or less hours per week, depending on the nature and scope of the project. Some visas may have different durations and renewal policies, depending on the country of origin and the purpose of visit. Some tax regulations may differ for digital nomads than for residents, depending on the tax treaties and agreements between the countries. \n- Fourth, we need to synthesize the information from the passage and our commonsense knowledge into a concise and clear answer. We can restate the main idea of the question, acknowledge the individuality of the answer, and provide the email address as a source of further information. \n\n### Final answer: The duration of your work for a resident company depends on various factors that are unique to your situation. To find out more, you can contact the Resource Centre at 319@innopolis.ru, stating your name and surname."

    "answer": "The profiles are being approved on a first-come-first-serve basis. Please await, efforts are being made to expedite the process.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use both the context information and some commonsense knowledge. Here are the steps we can follow:\n\n- First, we need to understand what my.university is and what kind of profile it requires. According to the context information, my.university is a platform that connects students and alumni with the university community and various opportunities. The profile requires some basic information such as name, photo, major, graduation year, and bio.\n- Second, we need to infer why the profile might not be approved. There could be several reasons, such as incomplete or inaccurate information, low-quality or inappropriate photo, or violation of the platform rules. The context information suggests that the profiles are being approved on first come first serve basis, which means that the approval process is based on the order of receiving the profiles and not on the quality or completeness of them.\n- Third, we need to evaluate if there is any way to speed up the process. Since the approval process is based on the order of receiving the profiles, there is no obvious way to make the profile approved faster than others, unless the user has some special status or connection with the platform administrators. However, this is not mentioned in the context information and might be unlikely or unethical.\n- Therefore, we can conclude that the user has to wait for their turn to get their profile approved, and there is no reliable or effective way to speed up the process. The answer could be something like:\n\nAnswer: Your profile at my.university is not approved because there are many other profiles that have been submitted before yours, and they are being approved on first come first serve basis. There is no way to speed up the process, unless you have some special status or connection with the platform administrators, which is not mentioned in the context information and might be unlikely or unethical.

    "question": "Why do I need to be registered for military services?",
    "answer": "Russian law states that citizens must be registered for military services unless exempted or meeting specific criteria. Failure to register if not exempt can lead to administrative liability.",
    "generated_answer": "Possible answer:\n\nYou may need to be registered for military services if you are a citizen or resident of a country that requires compulsory military service for certain age groups. Compulsory military service means that you have to serve in the armed forces for a certain period of time, usually after completing your education. This is different from voluntary military service, where you can choose to join the military if you meet the eligibility criteria and are willing to accept the terms and conditions.\n\nSome countries that have compulsory military service include South Korea, Israel, Switzerland, Norway, and North Korea. However, the rules and regulations vary depending on the country and the specific circumstances of each individual. For example, in South Korea, men between 19 and 28 years old are required to serve in the military for about 18 months, while women are exempted unless they voluntarily enlist. In Israel, both men and women who are citizens or residents are obligated to serve for at least two years, but they can defer their service for various reasons, such as studying abroad, pursuing a career, or having health issues.\n\nIf you are not sure whether you need to be registered for military services, you should consult the official authorities of your country and check the applicable laws and regulations. You may also want to research the benefits and challenges of joining the military, as well as the alternatives and options available to you. Being registered for military services can have a significant impact on your life, so it is important to make an informed decision"

    "question": "What types of scholarships do exist?",
    "answer": "Several scholarships exist, including academic, state academic, social, higher academic scholarships, and presidential/governmental scholarships, each with different eligibility criteria.",
    "generated_answer": "There are different types of scholarships that students can apply for, depending on their needs, goals and eligibility criteria. Some common types of scholarships are:\n\n- Merit-based scholarships: These are awarded based on academic achievement, talent, leadership or other personal qualities. They usually do not require financial need as a factor, but may have specific requirements for the field of study, the level of education, the country of origin or the intended destination. Some examples of merit-based scholarships are the Fulbright Scholarship, the Chevening Scholarship and the Gates Cambridge Scholarship.\n- Need-based scholarships: These are awarded based on financial need, which is usually assessed by comparing the cost of education and living expenses with the available income and assets of the applicant or their family. They may have different criteria for calculating the amount of need, such as the number of dependents, the size of the family, the tax bracket or the total debt. Some examples of need-based scholarships are the Pell Grant, the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant and the State Scholarship Program.\n- Institution-specific scholarships: These are awarded by a specific college, university or program that the applicant is interested in attending or joining. They may have their own criteria for selecting recipients, such as academic performance, extracurricular involvement, research potential, diversity or community service. They may also have different deadlines, amounts and renewal conditions than other types of scholarships. Some examples of institution-specific scholarships are the Harvard Scholarship, the Stanford Need-based Financial Aid and the MIT Ingenuity Scholars Program.\n- External or third-party scholarships: These are awarded by organizations, foundations, corporations, governments or individuals that are not affiliated with any educational institution. They may have their own goals, missions or agendas for supporting students, such as promoting a certain field of study, a specific region, a religious group, an ethnic group or a social cause. They may also have different eligibility requirements, application procedures and deadlines than other types of scholarships. Some examples of external or third-party scholarships are the Rotary International Scholarship, the Boren Awards and the Japan Student Services Organization Scholarship.\n\nSome possible ways to continue the conversation are:\n\n- If you want to learn more about a specific type of scholarship, you can ask me to provide more details or examples for that category. For example, you can say \"Can you tell me more about merit-based scholarships?\" or \"What are some external or third-party scholarships that I can apply for?\"\n- If you want to search for scholarships that match your profile and preferences, you can ask me to help you with that. For example, you can say \"Can you find me some scholarships that I am eligible for?\" or \"What are some scholarships that support students in my field of study?\"\n- If you want to get some advice or tips on how to apply for scholarships successfully, you can ask me to share some insights or recommendations. For example, you can say \"How can I improve my chances of getting a merit-based scholarship?\" or \"What are some common mistakes that students make when applying for external or third-party scholarships?\"\n"

    "question": "How can I order a European Supplement?",
    "answer": "To order a European Diploma Supplement, complete an application, pay the administration fee, then bring the completed application and receipt to room 319 or contact @StudentAffairs_bot.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer this query, we need to use both the passage and some commonsense knowledge. Here are the steps we can follow:\n\n- First, we need to identify what is a European supplement and why someone might want to order it. A European supplement is an optional document that certifies the academic recognition of the courses taken at InnoPolis University for foreign students who have a different higher education system than the ECTS. For example, students from China or Japan might need this supplement to transfer their credits to their home universities.\n- Second, we need to find out if the passage mentions anything about how to order a European supplement. The passage does not provide any specific information on this topic, but it does mention that the terms and conditions will be sent in advance by the Faculty Support and Affairs department. This implies that the department is responsible for handling the administrative issues related to the courses, including the European supplement.\n- Third, we need to use some commonsense knowledge to infer what the possible ways of ordering a European supplement are. We can assume that the faculty support and affairs department has an email address or a phone number that interested students can contact. We can also assume that the students need to provide some documents, such as their passport, resident and contact details, certificate of no criminal records, bank details, work record book, \u0418\u041d\u041d, and \u0421\u041d\u0418\u041b\u0421 if available, to prove their identity and eligibility for the supplement. Additionally, we can assume that the students need to pay a fee for the supplement, which can be arranged in different ways, such as monthly, split in 2 parts, or at the end of the course, according to the passage.\n\n### Final answer: To order a European supplement, you need to contact the Faculty Support and Affairs department by email or phone, provide them with the required documents and pay the fee."

    "question": "What obligations do I have once leaving the University?",
    "answer": "When leaving the University, complete the checkout list by visiting IU departments (e.g., IT, library) to clear debts and return IU properties. Bring the completed list, student card, and pass to room 319.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider two aspects: the agreement with Innopolis University and the ethical and professional standards of the field. Here are some possible steps to find the answer:\n\n- Step 1: Review the agreement with Innopolis University and identify any clauses that relate to the obligations after leaving the university, such as confidentiality, intellectual property rights, publication, feedback, etc.\n- Step 2: Consult the ethical and professional standards of the field and see if they provide any guidance on how to handle the research data, publications, collaborations, mentoring, etc. after leaving the university.\n- Step 3: Compare the agreement and the standards and see if there are any conflicts or gaps that need to be resolved or addressed. For example, if the agreement requires the publication of some results within a certain time frame, but the field standard is to publish only after a longer period of review, then we need to decide which one to follow or negotiate with the university.\n- Step 4: Write down the main obligations and explain how they are derived from the agreement and the standards. For example, one possible answer could be:\n\n### Final answer: After leaving Innopolis University, I have the following obligations:\n\n- To maintain the confidentiality of any sensitive or proprietary information that I obtained or accessed during my affiliation with the university, unless I have written permission from the university to disclose it. This is based on the agreement clause 7.1.\n- To acknowledge the support and contribution of Innopolis University and its faculty, staff, and students in any research publications that result from or are related to my work at the university. This is based on the ethical standard of giving proper credit and recognition to collaborators and sponsors.\n- To inform the university of any changes or updates in my contact information, research status, and career goals.

    "question": "I'm not in my course telegram channel, what can I do?",
    "answer": "Message @StudentAffairs_bot to be added to your course channel.",
    "generated_answer": "One possible answer is:\n\nI understand that you are not in your course telegram channel and you want to know what you can do. Here are some suggestions:\n\n- First, check if you have joined the correct channel when you enrolled in the course. You can find the channel name and the invitation link in the course outline or syllabus. If you have joined the wrong channel, you can leave it and join the correct one with the same link.\n- Second, check if you have received any notifications from the channel, such as messages, files, polls, or events. You can do this by going to Telegram and checking your channels tab. If you see any activity from the channel, you are already a member of it. If not, you may have missed the invitation or there might be some technical issue with the channel.\n- Third, contact your instructor or TA and ask them to add you to the channel. They should be able to do so if you are on their class list. You can also explain why you are not in the channel and request a link or an invitation. Be polite and respectful when you communicate with them.\n- Fourth, look for alternative sources of information and communication within the course. You can check the course website, email, or other platforms for announcements, assignments, and feedback. You can also ask questions or share your ideas with your classmates through other means, such as online forums, social media, or video calls.\n- Fifth, consider joining a different channel that covers similar topics or skills as your course. For example, you can join the English for Academic Purposes channel, which is a general channel for students who want to improve their academic writing and speaking skills. You can also join other channels related to your discipline or interests and network with other learners.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find a way to access the course materials and interact with your instructor and peers. If you have any further questions, please let me know."

    "question": "Can the University cover the expenses for participation in a conference, hackathon, olympiad, etc.?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can apply for expense reimbursement for events outside IU via the university portal, following specific steps and providing necessary documents.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to use the information from the context files and some commonsense knowledge. Here are the steps we can follow:\n\n- First, we need to identify what kind of activity the query is referring to. The query gives some examples of possible activities, such as a conference, hackathon, or olympiad. These are all events that involve learning, networking, or competing with others in a relevant field of study.\n- Second, we need to check if these activities are considered educational activities and events by Innopolis University. This is important because the context files state that Innopolis University typically covers travel and other costs, related to participation in educational activities and events in Innopolis University. Therefore, we need to determine if a conference, hackathon, or olympiad can be classified as an educational activity and event by the university.\n- Third, we need to look for any details or limits that are specified in the agreement. This is relevant because the context files mention that there might be some restrictions on the coverage of travel and other costs, depending on the terms of the agreement between the university and the participant. Therefore, we need to find out if there are any conditions or exceptions that apply to these activities.\n- Fourth, based on the information from the previous steps, we can answer the query by stating whether the university can cover the expenses for participation in such activities or not. We can also explain why we reached this conclusion and provide some examples if possible.\n\n### Final answer: The university can cover the expenses for participation in a conference, hackathon, olympiad, etc., if they are educational activities and events that are approved by the university and within the limits of the agreement. However, there might be some cases where the coverage is not available or partially covered, depending on the nature and purpose of the activity, as well as the budget and availability of the university. For example, if a participant wants to attend a conference that is not related to their major or field of study, they might have to pay for their own travel costs, or if a participant wants to join a hackathon that requires a lot of equipment or software, they might have to share the costs with other participants. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with the university before registering for any such activities and to clarify the terms and conditions of the agreement."
