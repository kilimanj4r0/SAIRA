    "question": "How do we pass Physical Education at Innopolis University?",
    "answer": "Education Department sets a minimum of credit units required to pass a PE test. This information is depicted in Moodle. Student has to accumulate a certain number of attendance hours in Sports Complex of Innopolis, as well as has to pass the standards before the deadline.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the question, we need to understand what it means to pass Physical Education at Innopolis University and what are the requirements for doing so. We can use the context information provided by the user to help us with this task. Here are the steps we can follow:\n\n- First, we need to identify the main keywords in the question and the context information. The keywords are Physical Education, Innopolis University, pass, credit units, Moodle, attendance hours, Sports Complex, standards, and deadline.\n- Second, we need to match the keywords from the question with the relevant information from the context. For example, Physical Education is a subject offered by the Education Department at Innopolis University, pass means to achieve a satisfactory grade, credit units are the minimum number of hours required to complete the subject, Moodle is the online platform where the course details are displayed, attendance hours are the minutes spent in the Sports Complex doing physical activities, standards are the criteria for evaluating the performance of the students, and deadline is the date by which the students have to finish the subject.\n- Third, we need to synthesize the information from the context and form a coherent answer that addresses the question. We can use the keywords as clues to structure our answer. For example, we can start with introducing the subject and the university, then explain what are the requirements for passing the subject, and finally mention the source of the information.\n- Fourth, we need to write the answer in a clear and concise way, using proper grammar and punctuation. We also need to cite the source of the information when necessary.\n\nHere is an example of how we can write the answer:\n\n### Final answer: To pass Physical Education at Innopolis University, you have to complete a certain number of credit units by attending the Sports Complex and meeting the standards. The Education Department sets these requirements and displays them on Moodle. You have to accumulate enough attendance hours and pass the standards before the deadline to pass the subject."

    "question": "When can I start visiting the Sports Complex?",
    "answer": "From the 1st of September, after you are officially enrolled.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer your query, we need to use the information from the context and some commonsense knowledge. Here are the steps:\n\n- First, we need to identify what kind of information is relevant for your query. In this case, you are interested in the opening hours or days of the Sport Complex, which is a facility that offers various sports activities indoors.\n- Second, we need to look for any clues or hints in the context that might indicate when the Sport Complex is open. Unfortunately, the context does not provide any specific details about the Sport Complex, such as its location, contact information, or schedule. Therefore, we cannot directly answer your query from the context alone.\n- Third, we need to use some commonsense knowledge to infer a possible answer based on general assumptions and expectations. For example, we can assume that the Sport Complex is open during the daytime, since most sports activities require natural light or artificial illumination. We can also assume that the Sport Complex is closed on some public holidays or special occasions, such as weekends, national days, or religious festivals. However, these assumptions may not be accurate or applicable to your situation, depending on the type of sport, the availability of staff, and the preferences of the management.\n- Fourth, we need to formulate a tentative answer that expresses our uncertainty and acknowledges the limitations of our inference. For example, we can say something like \"You can start visiting the Sport Complex during the daytime on weekdays, unless there are any special announcements or closures due to holidays or events.\" This answer reflects our lack of certainty and our reliance on general knowledge, rather than specific information.\n\n### Final answer: You can start visiting the Sport Complex during the daytime on weekdays, unless there are any special announcements or closures due to holidays or events."

    "question": "When do we have retakes at Innopolis University?",
    "answer": "Student is offered two retakes, the dates are scheduled by Education Department. Information is delivered to student's @innopolis.ru",
    "generated_answer": "To answer this question, we need to read the context information carefully and look for any clues that might indicate when retakes take place at Innopolis University. We can use the following steps to find the answer:\n\n- Step 1: Locate the relevant section of the context information. In this case, it is the paragraph that starts with \"13.\" and ends with \"following semesters.\" This section seems to describe the rules and consequences for students who do not pay their academic debt in time.\n- Step 2: Identify the key words or phrases that relate to the question. In this case, they are \"expelled\" and \"retakes\". The word \"retakes\" is what we are looking for as an answer, while the word \"expelled\" tells us what happens if students do not pay their academic debt in time.\n- Step 3: Extract the answer from the relevant section. In this case, the answer is given in the last sentence of the paragraph: \"The retakes take place during the first week of the following semesters.\" This means that students who fail to pay their academic debt in time can have another chance to pass the course by taking a retake exam during the first week of the next semester.\n- Step 4: Summarize the answer in a concise and clear way. In this case, we can use the same words as the context information, but add a comma and a conjunction to make it more grammatical. The final answer is: \"The retakes take place during the first week of the following semester, comrade.\"\n\n### Final answer: The retakes take place during the first week of the following semester, comrade."

    "question": "What to do if I got ill before an exam and couldn't prepare properly?",
    "answer": "In this case you have notify Education Department and Student Affairs Department: write to 319@innopolis.ru, present original documents confirming your health condition, write an application to ask to move the date of your individual exam due to health issues. This application will be considered on an individual basis.",
    "generated_answer": "One possible answer is:\n\nIf you got ill before an exam and couldn't prepare properly, there are some steps you can take to minimize the impact on your grade. Here are some suggestions:\n\n- Contact your instructor as soon as possible and explain your situation. Be honest and respectful, and provide any evidence of your illness, such as a doctor's note or a screenshot of your online consultation.\n- Ask for an extension or a reschedule of the exam, if possible. Depending on the course and the instructor, you may be able to take the exam at a later date or time, or to have more time to complete it online. Make sure to agree on the terms and conditions of the extension or reschedule, such as the deadline, the format, the rules, and the penalties for non-compliance.\n- If an extension or a reschedule is not possible or acceptable, ask for alternative assessment methods. For example, you can request to take a partial exam that covers only the topics you have studied, or to submit a written report or a project on a related topic instead of the exam. Make sure to clarify the criteria and expectations for the alternative assessment, such as the length, the structure, the sources, and the feedback.\n- If none of the above options are available or suitable, ask for academic support. For example, you can seek help from your peers, your instructor, or the Student Support and Development Department. They may be able to provide you with some tips, guidance, or resources on how to improve your performance on the exam or to catch up on the missed content.\n- Finally, remember that getting ill is not your fault and that it does not define your worth as a student. Try to cope with the stress and anxiety that may arise from this situation, and focus on your recovery and well-being. You can use some of the following strategies: breathe deeply and slowly, drink enough water, eat healthy foods, get enough sleep, exercise moderately, listen to music, meditate, or talk to someone you trust.\n\nI hope this answer helps you deal with your situation. I wish you all the best for your exam and your health."

    "answer": "Applications are open at the beginning of each semester. International Relations Office will send an email to all students about the beginning of the application campaign and step-by-step guide to application process.",

We can use the following steps:\n\n- Step 1: Identify the type of program that the query is asking about. In this case, it is an exchange program, which means a study abroad program at a partner university.\n- Step 2: Look for the programs that match the criteria of being exchange programs and having partnerships with the home institution.
