    "question": "What may be the consequence of my failure to obey dorm rules?",
    "answer": "Administrative violations are recorded in the student's profile, leading to warnings, official reprimands, or expulsion.",
    "generated_answer": "\nThe consequences of failing to obey dorm rules can vary depending on the severity of the violation. Here are some possible outcomes:\n\n1. Verbal warning: The dorm staff may give you a verbal warning, which is a formal notification that you have broken the rules. This typically does not result in any penalty or consequence, but it serves as a reminder to follow the rules moving forward.\n2. Written warning: If your violation is more severe, you may receive a written warning. This is a formal document that outlines the rule you broke and the consequences of breaking it. The consequences could include a fine or temporary loss of privileges, such as access to the common room or internet.\n3. Suspension: In some cases, violations can lead to suspension from the dorm. During this time, you may be required to leave the dorm premises and find alternative accommodation until your suspension is lifted. The length of the suspension will depend on the severity of the violation and the rules in place at the dorm.\n4. Expulsion: In extreme cases, violating dorm rules can lead to expulsion from the dorm. This typically occurs when the violation is particularly severe or repeated. Expulsion may be temporary or permanent, depending on the circumstances.\n\nIt's important to note that while the consequences of breaking dorm rules can vary, they are generally intended to help maintain a safe and respectful living environment for all students. By following the rules, you can contribute to a positive atmosphere in the dorm and avoid any potential negative consequences."
