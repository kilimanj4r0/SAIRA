    "generated_answer": "\nReferences are an essential part of academic writing to provide credit to the original authors of the ideas used in a piece of work. There are different citation styles that can be used depending on the discipline or publication requirements. Some common citation styles include APA, MLA, and Chicago.\n\nThe types of references that exist can vary depending on the style used, but generally, they fall into three categories: primary sources, secondary sources, and tertiary sources.\n\nPrimary sources are original documents created by the author of the information, such as a research paper, book, or report. Secondary sources are interpretations of primary sources, such as articles, book reviews, or encyclopedias. Tertiary sources are compilations of secondary sources, such as anthologies, handbooks, or textbooks.\n\nIn terms of citation styles, APA typically uses a specific format for each type of reference, while MLA and Chicago may use slightly different formats. However, the basic information that should be included in a reference remains consistent across styles. This includes the author's name, publication date, title of the work, and publication information (such as journal name or publisher).\n\nIt is important to note that there are also specific rules for referencing electronic sources and sources that do not have a publication date. The citation style guide will provide more detailed information on how to format these types of references."
