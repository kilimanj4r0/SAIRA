    "question": "I volunteered at some event, how quickly will I get innopoints for that?",
    "answer": "Innopoints for volunteering requests will be credited to your account within 14 calendar days.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find relevant information from the sources. We can use keywords or phrases from the query to search for matching sentences in the sources. For example, we can search for \"volunteer\" or \"event\" in the sources. Alternatively, we can scan the sources for any mention of innopoints or rewards.\n\nWe find one sentence that mentions volunteering and innopoints in the source file_path: ../data/raw/raw_others_the_guidelines_%26_faq_for_offering_elective_courses_at_innopolis_university.md, which is:\n\n- Innopoints are awarded for various activities such as teaching, research, mentoring, organizing events, volunteering, etc. The amount of innopoints depends on the type, scope and impact of the activity.\n\nThis sentence gives us some general information about how innopoints are awarded, but it does not specify how quickly or how much. Therefore, we cannot answer the query with certainty based on this source alone. We need to look for more sources that might provide more details or examples.\n\nWe do not find any other sources that mention volunteering or innopoints directly, so we have to make an inference based on the available information. We can use some commonsense knowledge and assumptions to estimate how quickly one might get innopoints for volunteering at some event. Some possible steps are:\n\n- Assume that Innopolis University values volunteering as a contribution to the community and the university, and thus rewards it with innopoints.\n- Assume that Innopolis University has some criteria or standards for evaluating the quality and quantity of volunteering activities, such as the duration, the frequency, the impact, the feedback, etc.\n- Assume that Innopolis University has some mechanism or process for verifying and certifying the volunteering activities, such as submission of documents, photos, videos, testimonials, etc.\n- Assume that Innopolis University has some deadline or period for claiming innopoints for volunteering activities, such as at the end of each term, semester, year, etc.\n- Estimate how long it might take to complete these steps and receive the innopoints, depending on the nature and scope of the event, the availability and accessibility of the evidence, the workload and responsiveness of the university staff, etc.\n\nBased on these assumptions and estimates, we can generate a possible answer to the query, such as:\n\n- It depends on how you document and submit your volunteering activity to the university. You might need to provide some proof or evidence of your participation and contribution to the event, such as photos, videos, certificates, testimonials, etc. The university might have some form or platform for uploading these documents and claiming your innopoints.\n- It also depends on how the university evaluates and awards your volunteering activity. They might have some criteria or standards for determining the amount of innopoints you deserve, based on the type, scope and impact of your activity. The university might have some deadline or period for claiming your innopoints, such as at the end of each term, semester, year, etc.\n- It could take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on how quickly you complete the steps and how efficiently the university processes your request. You should contact the university staff or check their website for more details and guidance on how to claim your innopoints for volunteering.\n\n### Final answer: It depends on how you document and submit your volunteering activity, how the university evaluates and awards it, and how quickly they process your request. You should contact the university staff or check their website for more details and guidance."
