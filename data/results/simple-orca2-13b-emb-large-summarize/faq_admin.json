    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, I need to search through the information from multiple sources and find the relevant part that mentions the production time of references. Here are the steps I followed:\n\n- I searched for the word \"produce\" or \"production\" in the information sources. I found that these words were used in the context of references five times, in the following files: ../data/raw/raw_faq_Admin.md, ../data/raw/raw_faq_Admin.md, ../data/raw/raw_handbook_5. How to Order References?.md, ../data/raw/raw_bsc_englishforacademicpurposesii.md, and ../data/raw/raw_bsc_operatingsystems.f21.md.\n- I scanned through these files and looked for any mention of time or deadline related to references. I found that only two files had such information: ../data/raw/raw_faq_Admin.md and ../data/raw/raw_handbook_5.

    "question": "If I cannot pick my reference, can somebody else collect it for me?",
    "answer": "Yes. To do this, a student must write a letter of attorney. To collect the reference, a person must present their ID and a letter of attorney.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer your query, we need to search for relevant information in the given sources. We can use keywords or phrases from your query to help us find the most relevant source. For example, we can look for \"pick\", \"collect\" or \"reference\" in the sources. Alternatively, we can look for the type of reference you need and see if there is any information about how to order or collect it. Here are some steps we can follow:\n\n- Step 1: Identify the type of reference you need. You mentioned that you need an academic transcript, which is a document that shows your grades and credits.\n- Step 2: Find the source that contains information about how to order or collect an academic transcript. We can see that there are two sources that mention this type of reference: file_path: ../data/raw/raw_faq_Admin.md and file_path: ../data/raw/raw_bsc_englishforacademicpurposesi.md\n- Step 3: Compare the information from both sources and see if there are any differences or contradictions. We can notice that the first source says it takes 7 working days to produce an academic transcript, while the second source says it takes 5 working days. This could be a discrepancy between the sources, or it could be a difference between the types of references available (for example, a translated or notarized transcript might take longer).\n- Step 4: Choose the most reliable or relevant source based on your situation and needs. For example, if you need an academic transcript urgently, you might prefer the source that says it takes 5 working days to produce. If you need a translated or notarized transcript, you might prefer the source that has more details about the process and requirements.\n- Step 5: Follow the instructions from the chosen source to order or collect your reference. For example, if you choose the first source, you would write a letter of attorney and present your ID at room 432 or message d.ziatdinova@innopolis.ru. If you choose the second source, you would select the right type of reference, amount of copies and for whom are you ordering it on MyUniversity.\n\n### Final answer: To find out if somebody else can collect your reference for you, you need to identify the type of reference you need, find the source that contains information about how to order or collect it, compare the information from different sources, choose the most reliable or relevant source, and follow the instructions from that source."

    "answer": "No, references are produced in hard copy format only.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find the relevant information from the given sources. We can use keywords or phrases from the query to locate the possible matches. For example, we can search for \"reference\" or \"digital format\" in the sources.\n\nOne of the sources that contains the term \"reference\" is the file_path: ../data/raw/raw_faq_Admin.md.

However, it does not mention anything about digital format or online access.\n\nAnother source that contains the term \"digital format\" is the file_path: ../data/raw/raw_msc__classical_internet_applications.md. This source is an open access resource for a master course on classical internet applications. It lists some of the lecture slides and RFCs (Request for Comments) that are relevant to the topic.

Scholarships & Financial Support.md, which says: \"Increased scholarship Increased scholarship competition is held every semester to reward students with outstanding achievements in different fields. The amount of increased scholarship is 6,000 rubles.

Scholarships & Financial Support.md, which says: \"Financial Support If you need financial support due to some personal or unexpected reasons, approach Student Affairs Office to fill financial support application in room 319.

    "question": "What are the working hours of 319 office?",
    "answer": "Monday to Friday from 14:00 to 18:00",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find the source that contains the relevant information. A possible way to do this is to scan the file paths for any mention of \"319 office\" or \"319\". \n\nWe can see that there are three sources that contain \"319\":\n\n- ../data/raw/raw_faq_Admin.md\n- ../data/raw/raw_others_faq_For_offering_an_elective.md\n- ../data/raw/raw_others_the_guidelines_%26_faq_for_offering_elective_courses_at_innopolis_university.md\n\nWe can open any of these sources and look for the working hours of 319 office. The first source seems to be a general FAQ for the admin department, and it mentions that 319 is responsible for organizational things such as schedule, booking rooms, and providing the equipment. However, it does not specify the working hours of 319.\n\nThe second source also mentions that 319 is responsible for organizational things, but it does not mention the working hours either. It only says to contact Viktoria by telegram or email for elective courses.\n\nThe third source is similar to the first one, and it also mentions that 319 is responsible for organizational things, but again it does not mention the working hours. It only says to contact Viktoria by telegram or email for offering elective courses at Innopolis University.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that none of the sources provide the working hours of 319 office. We might need to ask someone who works at 319 or check the internal website of Innopolis University to find out the working hours. Alternatively, we could say that the working hours of 319 are not given in the sources and that more information is needed.\n\n### Final answer: The working hours of 319 office are not given in the sources. More information is needed."

    "question": "Can the University cover the expenses for participation in a conference, hackathon, olympiad, etc.?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can apply for expense reimbursement for events outside IU via the university portal, following specific steps and providing necessary documents.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to analyze the information from multiple sources and extract the relevant facts. Here are some possible steps:\n\n- Identify the main topic of the query, which is whether the university covers the expenses for participation in various events outside IU.\n- Scan the information from multiple sources and look for any mention of this topic or related terms, such as refund, reimbursement, compensation, support, etc.\n- Compare and contrast the different sources and see if they agree or disagree on this issue, or if they have different conditions or exceptions.\n- Summarize the main findings from the sources and provide a brief final answer.\n\nHere is an example of how to apply these steps:\n\n- The main topic of the query is whether the university covers the expenses for participation in various events outside IU. This is what we are looking for in the information from multiple sources.\n- We can scan the information and find that there are three sources that mention this issue: the handbook, the FAQ, and the guidelines. The handbook says that the university typically covers travel and other costs related to participation in educational activities and events in Innopolis University, but it does not specify any details or limits. The FAQ also says that the university covers travel and other expenses for participation in conferences, hackathons, olympiads, etc., but it requires the applicants to fill an application form, provide proof of expenses, and wait for the commission's decision. The guidelines do not mention anything about this issue, but they imply that the university does not pay for business trips to Innopolis unless there is an agreement.\n- We can compare and contrast the different sources and see that they agree on the general idea that the university covers some expenses for participation in events outside IU, but they have different conditions and exceptions. The handbook is vague and broad, while the FAQ is specific and narrow. The guidelines are irrelevant and outdated.\n- We can summarize the main findings from the sources and provide a brief final answer. For example:\n\n### Final answer: The university may cover some expenses for participation in events outside IU, but it depends on the type of event, the purpose of participation, the availability of agreement, and the approval of commission. The applicants need to fill an application form, provide proof of expenses, and wait for the decision."
