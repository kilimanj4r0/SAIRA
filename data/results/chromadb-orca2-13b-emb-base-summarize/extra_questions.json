    "question": "If I am a teacher, is it necessary to share studying material only in moodle? Can I send materials as it is convenient for me?",
    "answer": "You can upload tasks to Moodle in advance and hide them from students, and open them when necessary. You can share a link to a chat/Telegram channel with students for assignments from Moodle.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer your query, we need to consider several factors. First, let us assume that you are a teacher at Innopolis University and you are using Moodle as your LMS. Second, let us define what studying material means. According to the Moodle documentation, studying material can include any resource that is relevant for learning, such as readings, videos, podcasts, quizzes, etc. Third, let us examine the benefits and challenges of sharing studying material only in Moodle or sending materials as it is convenient for you.\n\nSome possible benefits of sharing studying material only in Moodle are:\n\n- You can create a coherent and organized course structure that follows the learning outcomes and objectives.\n- You can provide a consistent and accessible environment for your students to access and interact with the materials.\n- You can track the usage and feedback of the materials by using Moodle analytics and reports.\n- You can ensure the quality and security of the materials by using Moodle plugins and features, such as file checking, license detection, content translation, etc.\n\nSome possible challenges of sharing studying material only in Moodle are:\n\n- You may have to spend more time and effort on creating and uploading the materials, especially if you have a large or diverse course content.\n- You may face technical issues or limitations that affect the performance or functionality of the materials, such as bandwidth, storage, compatibility, etc.\n- You may lose some control or flexibility over the materials, such as updating, deleting, or modifying them, if you share them only in Moodle and not elsewhere.\n- You may miss some opportunities to reach a wider or different audience for your materials, such as other teachers, researchers, or learners, if you do not share them outside of Moodle.\n\nSome possible benefits of sending materials as it is convenient for you are:\n\n- You can save time and energy on creating and uploading the materials, by using existing or external sources that suit your course design and delivery.\n- You can leverage the advantages of different platforms or tools that offer more features or services than Moodle, such as video hosting, podcasting, blogging, etc.\n- You can customize or personalize the materials to match your style and preferences, such as adding your own comments, annotations, graphics, etc.\n- You can share the materials with anyone you want, such as your colleagues, students, friends, family, etc., without having to worry about access permissions or restrictions.\n\nSome possible challenges of sending materials as it is convenient for you are:\n\n- You may have to deal with more complex or varied issues or expectations regarding the materials, such as copyright, format, quality, compatibility, etc.\n- You may face difficulties or conflicts in integrating the materials with Moodle, such as linking, embedding, uploading, etc.\n- You may lose some consistency or alignment of the materials with your course structure and objectives, which may affect the learning experience and outcomes of your students.\n- You may violate some policies or guidelines of Innopolis University or Moodle, such as plagiarism, confidentiality, accessibility, etc., by sending materials that are not appropriate or permitted.\n\nTherefore, to answer your query, it is not necessarily necessary to share studying material only in Moodle, but it depends on your situation and goals. You may choose to send materials as it is convenient for you, but you should also consider the potential consequences and implications of doing so. You should also balance the benefits and challenges of both approaches and ensure that you meet the requirements and expectations of Innopolis University and Moodle.\n\n### Final answer: Sharing studying material only in Moodle or sending materials as it is convenient for you are both possible options, but they have different advantages and disadvantages. You should weigh them carefully and follow the rules and norms of Innopolis University and Moodle."

    "question": "What is Grading range for getting A in Game Theory course?",
    "answer": "90-100",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find the grade range for getting an A in the game theory course. We can use the following steps:\n\n- Step 1: Look at the information from multiple sources and identify the relevant ones that contain the course grading range. In this case, we have five files with different names but similar content.\n- Step 2: Compare the course grading ranges across the files and look for any differences or inconsistencies. In this case, we can see that all the files use the same range except for one file that has a proposed range instead of the actual range. We can ignore this file as it does not reflect the current grading policy.\n- Step 3: Find the grade range that corresponds to an A in the course. In this case, we can see that all the files use the same description of performance for an A grade, which is 90-100. This means that getting an A in the course requires a score of 90 or above out of 100.\n- Step 4: Write the answer based on the findings from the previous steps. In this case, we can write: The grading range for getting an A in the game theory course is 90-100. This means that students need to score 90 or above out of 100 to get an A in the course.\n\n### Final answer: The grading range for getting an A in the game theory course is 90-100."
