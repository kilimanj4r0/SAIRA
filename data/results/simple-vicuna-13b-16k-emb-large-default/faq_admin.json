If you do not fall under any of these categories and avoid military service registration, you may face administrative liability as per Article 21.5 of the Code of Administrative Offenses.\n\nThe rules for registering for military services are outlined in a separate document titled \"Rules of Registration for Military Service.\" According to these guidelines, you will need to obtain temporary registration by picking up documents prepared by the dorm, pass your documents and passport at the city council office during reception hours, collect the necessary documents including a copy of your passport's first page and residence permit, academic reference, military service registration certificate, and application for military service registration.

If you have received a request for Reference - Appendix 4 from a previous military office, you must also order it through my.university within five working days.\n\nDeferment from spring/fall call-ups for military service is granted after signing a summons, passing tests at the medical center of Innopolis, and passing the medical commission at the Central District Hospital of Verkhny Uslon without passing the medical commission. Deferments are only valid once unless you have received a previous expulsion from a university or receive a second higher education."
