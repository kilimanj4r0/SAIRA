    "answer": "No, pets are not allowed in the dormitory. The dormitory rules explicitly state that pets are prohibited within the premises.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find the relevant information in the context information. We can use keywords or phrases to locate the part of the text that might contain the answer. For example, we can search for \"pets\" in the context information.\n\nWe find one occurrence of the word \"pets\" in the dormitory basic rules section. The rule says: \"Pets are not allowed.\" This means that having a pet in the dormitory is prohibited and violates the rules. Therefore, the answer to the query is no.\n\nTo write the answer, we can use the following template:\n\nNo, you cannot have a pet in the dormitory because {reason}.\n\nWe fill in the reason with the relevant information from the context information. We can rephrase or paraphrase the information to make it more concise and clear. For example, we can say:\n\nNo, you cannot have a pet in the dormitory because pets are not allowed according to the dormitory basic rules.\n\nWe output the final answer as follows:\n\n### Final answer: No, you cannot have a pet in the dormitory because pets are not allowed according to the dormitory basic rules."

    "question": "Hello, what should I do if I need additional keys for the dormitory room?",
    "answer": "Hi there! To obtain additional keys for your dormitory room, please visit the dormitory administration on the 1st floor of the 3rd dormitory building. They'll assist you with the process of getting extra keys.",
    "generated_answer": "Hello, user. Thank you for your query. Based on the context information, here are some possible steps to follow if you need additional keys for the dormitory room:\n\n- First, check the inventory of keys that you have received when you moved in. You should have one master key and one duplicate key for your room lock. If you do not have these keys or they are broken, report to the dormitory administration on the 1st floor of the 3rd dorm or text @Inno_dorm as soon as possible.\n- Second, if you need a spare key for guest purposes or temporary use, you can request one from the dormitory administration as well. They will charge you a small fee for making and issuing the duplicate key. You should also arrange a guest pass or book a place for your guests via the dormitory website before they arrive.\n- Third, do not share your keys with anyone who is not authorized to enter the dormitory or your room. This includes other students, staff, or outsiders. Doing so may violate the dormitory rules and put you and others at risk of theft, vandalism, or fire hazards. You are responsible for your own keys and their usage.\n- Fourth, keep your keys safe and secure. Do not lose them, lend them, or damage them. If you do, you may have to pay for a replacement or face disciplinary sanctions. You should also report any lost or stolen keys to the dormitory administration as soon as possible.\n- Fifth, return your keys when you move out of the dormitory or change rooms. You will receive a refund for the duplicate key if you have paid for it and it is in good condition. Otherwise, you may have to pay for a replacement or face disciplinary sanctions.\n\nI hope this information helps you, user. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask me. Have a nice day!"

    "question": "Hello, I am an international student. Do I need to do anything when I arrive at Innopolis?",
    "answer": "Hello! Upon your return to Innopolis University, as an international student, promptly upload your migration card and passport scans within three days on My University's \"Migration Card\" section. Then, submit visa details in the \"Visa\" section, followed by uploading your new registration card scan and related information in the \"Registration\" section. Non-compliance incurs a 2000 ruble late fee at Verkhny Uslon's Migration department and potential deportation after two violations. It's crucial to follow these guidelines upon arrival to avoid penalties or deportation.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to use both the passage and some commonsense knowledge. We can follow these steps:\n\n- First, we need to identify who is the query sender. According to the context information, the query sender is an international student who has returned to Innopolis University after being abroad or in another accommodation for at least one night.\n- Second, we need to understand what are the migration control regulations for international students at Innopolis University. According to the passage, there are three buttons that the query sender needs to upload the scans of their documents and fill the gaps with the information about their visa, migration card, and registration. The query sender also needs to join the International students' telegram channel and text @Daria_cider if they have any questions.\n- Third, we need to check the deadline for uploading the documents and the consequences of being late or failing to do so. According to the passage, the query sender needs to upload the documents within 3 days once they return to Innopolis University. If they don't, they will pay a late fee of 2000 rubles themselves in the Migration department of Verkhny Uslon. Two failures will lead to their deportation.\n- Fourth, we need to summarize the main points and provide a brief final answer. We can use the following template:\n\nIn summary, as an international student who has returned to Innopolis University, you need to do the following: {list the steps}. If you don't do them on time, you will face serious penalties. ### Final answer: You need to upload your documents in your personal account, join the telegram channel, and text @Daria_cider if you have any questions."

    "question": "What is Grading range for getting A in Game Theory course?",
    "answer": "90-100",
    "generated_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use the proposed grading range for the course, which is given in the context information. We can assume that the grades are based on a percentage scale, where each grade corresponds to a certain range of percentages. For example, an A. Excellent grade means that the student has scored 90-100% in the course.\n\nTo find the grading range for getting an A in Game Theory course, we need to look at the table and see which percentage range includes the A. Excellent grade. We can do this by finding the lower and upper bounds of the range, and then comparing them with the course percentage. If the course percentage falls within or above the range, then the student has achieved an A. Excellent grade. Otherwise, the student has not.\n\nThe lower bound of the A. Excellent grade range is 90%, and the upper bound is 100%. The course percentage is unknown, so we cannot say for sure whether it falls within or above the range. However, we can say that if the course percentage is equal to or greater than 90%, then the student has achieved an A. Excellent grade. If the course percentage is less than 90%, then the student has not.\n\nTherefore, the grading range for getting an A in Game Theory course is 90-100%. ### Final answer: 90-100%"
