    "question": "I volunteered at some event, how quickly will I get innopoints for that?",
    "answer": "Innopoints for volunteering requests will be credited to your account within 14 calendar days.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to use the information from the sources and apply some logical reasoning. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n- First, we need to identify which source contains the most relevant information for the query. In this case, it is the file_path: ../data/raw/raw_faq_Extracurricular.md, which has a section titled \"How can I volunteer and get innopoints?\".\n- Second, we need to extract the relevant information from that source. The passage says that after making a request, innopoints will fall to your account no later than in 14 calendar days. It also says that you can create your own project and close it on the website to get innopoints.\n- Third, we need to use some commonsense knowledge and infer that if you volunteer at an event that is published on ipts.innopolis.university, you will be able to close it on the website and get innopoints. Otherwise, you will have to make a request to get innopoints.\n- Fourth, we need to synthesize the information and infer the answer. Based on the passage and our inference, we can say that if you volunteer at an event that is published on ipts.innopolis.university, you will get innopoints within 14 calendar days of closing the event on the website. If you volunteer at an event that is not published on ipts.innopolis.university, you will have to make a request to get innopoints within 14 calendar days of the event date.\n\n### Final answer: Within 14 calendar days of closing or requesting innopoints."
