    "question": "What may be the consequence of my failure to obey dorm rules?",
    "answer": "Administrative violations are recorded in the student's profile, leading to warnings, official reprimands, or expulsion.",
    "generated_answer": "One possible answer is:\n\nThe consequence of your failure to obey dorm rules may depend on the severity and frequency of your misconduct. According to the file_path: ../data/raw/raw_handbook_2. Accommodation & Meal Plan.md, some basic dorm rules are:\n\n- Be respectful.\n- Pets are not allowed.\n- Hours of silence: 10pm - 7am.\n- Alcohol, cigarettes (including hookahs, electronic cigarettes etc.), drugs and offensive behaviour/ are forbidden on the territory of the campus.\n- Be careful while cooking! Do not block fire detectors. Doing so will result in disciplinary sanctions.\n- To bring guests you'll need to arrange guest pass for them. To bring them overnight you'll have to book a place via dormitory website.\n\nThe file_path: ../data/raw/raw_others_about_lecturing_a_course.md, indicates that the penalty for violating academic regulations may range from zero points for the work to expulsion from Innopolis University, depending on the number and seriousness of the offences. The file_path: ../data/raw/raw_handbook_12. Migration Control for International Students.md, warns that not complying with migration control regulations may result in penalties or possible deportation.\n\nTherefore, if you fail to obey dorm rules, you may face any of the following consequences:\n\n- A warning, reprimand, or expulsion from the dorm administration, depending on the type and frequency of your violations.\n- A deduction of points for the course, if your misconduct affects your academic performance or integrity.\n- A fine, a ban, or a deportation from the country, if your misconduct involves alcohol, drugs, fire safety, or immigration issues.\n\nThese are some possible outcomes, but they are not exhaustive or definitive. You should always consult the relevant sources and authorities for more information and advice on how to avoid or rectify any violations of dorm rules"

    "question": "When are the dorm rooms cleaned?",
    "answer": "Cleaning schedules are set by accommodation administration. Visit dorm administration on dorm 3, floor 1, to clarify the cleaning time for your room.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find the relevant information from the context sources. We can use keywords or phrases to search for the answer in each source. For example, we can look for \"cleaning\" or \"room cleaning\" in the sources.\n\nWe can see that the first source mentions the cleaning schedule is planned by accommodation administration and gives a specific location to clarify the cleaning time of the room. The second source does not mention anything about cleaning or dorm rooms, so we can ignore it. The third source describes the basic facilities and rules of the dorm, but does not specify when the rooms are cleaned. The fourth source is about electives, which is irrelevant to the query, so we can skip it. The fifth source also does not mention anything about cleaning or dorm rooms, only the consequences of violating the rules.\n\nThe sixth source is an alternative link for the schedule for all years, but it does not contain any information about cleaning or dorm rooms either. The seventh source is a FAQ section for students and has two sub-sections: Year 1, Fall Semester and Schedule for all years. Neither of them have any details about cleaning or dorm rooms.\n\nTherefore, based on the context information, we can conclude that the query cannot be answered with certainty, as none of the sources provide a clear or consistent answer. However, we can infer that the rooms are cleaned regularly by the accommodation administration, but the exact frequency and time may vary depending on the location and availability of the cleaning staff.\n\n### Final answer: Unknown, but regularly by the accommodation administration."
