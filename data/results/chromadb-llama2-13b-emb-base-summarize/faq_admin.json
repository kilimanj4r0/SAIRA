    "question": "Can the University cover the expenses for participation in a conference, hackathon, olympiad, etc.?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can apply for expense reimbursement for events outside IU via the university portal, following specific steps and providing necessary documents.",
    "generated_answer": "From the information provided, it appears that some of the universities offering winter schools may provide financial assistance or coverage for certain expenses related to participating in conferences, hackathons, or other events. However, this is not a common practice and is typically not included in the tuition fee.\n\nFor instance, Hanyang University's International Winter School offers a discounted price of KRW 900,000 for online courses, while Korea University's International Winter Campus provides various discounts and scholarships available for participants. However, these discounts or financial assistance may not cover expenses related to participating in external events.\n\nIt is best to check with each university directly to determine if they offer any such coverage or support. Additionally, it's essential to review the terms and conditions of each program before enrolling to ensure that you understand what is included in the tuition fee and what additional expenses you may need to cover."
