    "answer": "Student clubs can apply for resources, promotion support, and participate in the Club League for points. Top clubs receive budgets for purchases, claim Higher Scholarships, and earn innopoints. Contact [@VOSpiridonova](http://t.me/VOSpiridonova) for queries and suggestions.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to extract relevant information from the context files. We can use keywords or phrases to locate the parts of the files that mention how the University supports student clubs. For example, we can search for \"resource provision\", \"promotion support\", \"Club League\", \"budget\", \"Higher Scholarship\" and \"innopoints\". These are all terms that describe some forms of support that the University provides to student clubs. We can also look for sentences that start with \"You'll\" or \"Learn how to\" as they indicate some benefits or outcomes of joining a student club.\n\nOnce we find the relevant parts, we need to summarize them and combine them into a coherent answer. We should use paraphrasing or quoting techniques to avoid plagiarism and maintain academic integrity. We should also use transition words or phrases to connect different ideas and make the answer flow smoothly.\n\nA possible answer is:\n\nThe University supports student clubs in various ways, such as providing them with resources, promotion, recognition, rewards and opportunities. For example, student clubs can apply for resource provision and promotion support from the University. They can also participate in Club League, where they earn points for different criteria and receive feedback. At the end of every semester, the top 20 clubs get a budget that they can spend on relevant purchases or services. Additionally, club leaders of the top 20 clubs can claim points for a Higher Scholarship every semester and innopoints in the end of academic year. By joining a student club, students can also learn more about themselves, develop soft skills, gain networking opportunities, acquire practical experience, engage with diverse groups of people, take a break from their studies, expand their CV and give back to the University.\n\n### Final answer: The University supports student clubs in various ways, such as providing them with resources, promotion, recognition, rewards and opportunities."
