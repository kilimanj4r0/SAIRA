    "question": "When can I start visiting the Sports Complex?",
    "answer": "From the 1st of September, after you are officially enrolled.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer this query, we need to use both the pieces of context information that are given. We can use a logical reasoning process to combine them and find the answer. Here are the steps:\n\n- First, we look at the file path for raw_faq_Academic.md, which is a file that contains frequently asked questions related to academic matters in Innopolis. This implies that the query is about an academic issue, or something related to it.\n- Second, we look at the question itself, which asks when one can start visiting the Sports Complex. The Sports Complex is a facility that offers indoor and outdoor sports activities for the citizens of Innopolis. This implies that the query is about a leisure or fitness issue, or something related to it.\n- Third, we look at the file path for raw_handbook_10. Your Health.md, which is a file that contains information about one's health and well-being in Innopolis. This implies that the query is about a health-related issue, or something related to it.\n- Fourth, we look at the context information from both files, which state that one can start visiting the Sports Complex from the 1st of September, after one is officially enrolled. This means that there is a condition for accessing the facility, which is being enrolled as a student or staff member in Innopolis.\n- Fifth, we combine all these pieces of information and form a logical answer, which is: One can start visiting the Sports Complex from the 1st of September, after one is officially enrolled as a student or staff member in Innopolis. This answer covers both the academic and health aspects of the query, and also provides a specific date and condition for the access.\n\n### Final answer: One can start visiting the Sports Complex from the 1st of September, after one is officially enrolled as a student or staff member in Innopolis."

    "question": "When do we have retakes at Innopolis University?",
    "answer": "Student is offered two retakes, the dates are scheduled by Education Department. Information is delivered to student's @innopolis.ru",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find relevant information from the context. We can use keywords or phrases to locate the possible sentences that contain the answer. For example, we can search for \"retakes\" or \"retake\" in the context. We find two sentences that mention retakes:\n\n- Student is offered two retakes, the dates are scheduled by Education Department. Information is delivered to student's @innopolis.ru\n- The retakes take place during the first week of the following semesters.\n\nWe can compare these two sentences and see that they have different sources and details. The first sentence implies that the retakes are arranged individually for each student who needs them, based on their academic performance and debt. The second sentence states that the retakes are scheduled collectively by the Education Department and happen at the same time every semester. We can also notice that the first sentence mentions an email address, while the second one does not. This suggests that the first sentence is more specific and personalized, while the second one is more general and standard.\n\nWe can use some commonsense knowledge to infer that the retakes are meant to give students another chance to pass the courses they failed or improve their grades. Therefore, we would expect the retakes to happen after the final exams of each semester, when the results are announced and the academic debt is calculated. We can also assume that the retakes are not offered to all students, but only to those who need them and qualify for them.\n\nBased on these assumptions and the information from the context, we can formulate a tentative answer to the query. We can also acknowledge the uncertainty and the sources of our answer, as well as the possibility of different scenarios depending on the student's situation and performance. A possible answer is:\n\n### Final answer: The retakes at Innopolis University are scheduled by the Education Department and take place during the first week of the following semesters, after the final exams and the calculation of the academic debt. However, this may vary depending on the student's individual circumstances and needs, as some students may be offered more or fewer retakes, or may have different dates and formats for their retakes, based on their email address."

For example:\n\n### Final answer: If you are ill before an exam and couldn't prepare properly, you should contact the Education Department and Student Affairs Department by emailing 319@innopolis.ru.

    "question": "Who can take part in exchange programs?",
    "answer": "You can find selection criteria here: <https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/Exchange_program.> Alternatively, you may contact International Relations Office in room 503A",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the question of who can take part in exchange programs at Innopolis University, we need to follow these steps:\n\n- First, we need to read the context information carefully and identify the relevant sections that mention the eligibility criteria for exchange programs. These are section 4 (Eligibility criteria) and section 9 (Partner Universities).\n- Second, we need to summarize the main points from these sections and compare them with the query. For example, we can say that students who want to apply for an exchange program should have a minimum GPA of 4.0 or 4.4 depending on whether they choose regular exchange or Erasmus+ program, and they should check the entry requirements of the partner university where they want to go. We can also mention that they should have completed certain semesters and trimesters depending on their level and the availability of courses at the partner university.\n- Third, we need to write a clear and concise answer that covers the main points from the previous step and addresses the query. For example, we can say:\n\n### Final answer: Students who want to take part in exchange programs at Innopolis University should have a minimum GPA of 4.0 or 4.4 depending on the type of program, and they should meet the academic requirements of the partner university where they want to go. They should also have completed certain semesters and trimesters according to their level and the availability of courses at the partner university."

    "question": "Where can I find information about exchange programs?",
    "answer": "1) by sending your request to international@innopolis.university\n2) by visiting International Relations Office in room 503 A\n3) by visiting innopolis.university/en/outgoingstudents",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to look for clues in the context information that match the topic of exchange programs. We can see that there are two possible sources of information in the context information: by sending your request to international@innopolis.university or by visiting International Relations Office in room 503 A. Both of these sources are related to the International Relations Office, which is the department that handles exchange programs. Therefore, we can infer that either source would provide information about exchange programs. However, if we want to choose the best source, we might consider which one is more convenient, reliable, and updated. Based on the context information, we can assume that sending an email to international@innopolis.university would be more convenient and reliable, since we can expect a timely and personalized response. On the other hand, visiting room 503 A might not be as convenient or reliable, since we might have to wait for a long time, deal with a busy schedule, or find the location. Moreover, we can assume that the email address would be more updated, since it would contain the latest information about exchange programs and their deadlines. Therefore, based on these considerations, we can recommend sending an email to international@innopolis.university as the best source of information about exchange programs. ### Final answer: Send your request to international@innopolis.university"

    "question": "Will I be getting IU scholarship for the time of the exchange semester?",
    "answer": "Yes, exchange students continue to receive scholarships. The scholarship is awarded based on the results of the intermediate results of the semester preceding the exchange semester.",
    "generated_answer": "Analysis:\nTo answer the question, we need to find the relevant information from the context files. The first file is about FAQ on academic matters, and the second file is about FAQ on administrative matters. We can infer that the question is related to the academic side of things, so we focus on the first file. There, we see that the answer to the question is yes, exchange students continue to receive scholarships based on the results of the semester before the exchange.

    "question": "How can I change my study group?",
    "answer": "1. Fill out an application form indicating the reason of study group change and bring it to 319 or send it to @StudentAffairs_bot (only if you are not in Russian Federation)\n2. Wait for the response that will be provided via email.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find the relevant information from the context files. The first file is about FAQ for academic purposes and the second file is about a course on English for academic purposes. We can assume that the query is related to the second file, since it mentions group work and study group. Therefore, we can use the information from the second file to answer the query.\n\nThe information from the second file says that there are three members per team for the group work assignment. It does not mention anything about changing the study group or how to do so. Therefore, we cannot answer the query based on this file alone. We need to use some commonsense knowledge and infer that changing the study group might be possible if the students have a valid reason and get permission from the instructor or the course coordinator. However, this is not explicitly stated in the file and might vary depending on the policy of the course or the institution.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can only provide a partial answer to the query. A possible answer is:\n\n### Final answer: You need to fill out an application form indicating the reason of study group change and bring it to 319 or send it to @StudentAffairs_bot (only if you are not in Russian Federation). However, this might not be possible or might require the instructor's approval, depending on the course policy."
