    "answer": "Administrative violations are recorded in the student's profile, leading to warnings, official reprimands, or expulsion.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, I will use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant part of the context information that relates to the query. In this case, it is the first paragraph from the file_path: ../data/raw/raw_faq_Household.md\nStep 2: Paraphrase or quote the relevant part of the context information in my own words.

    "question": "When are the dorm rooms cleaned?",
    "answer": "Cleaning schedules are set by accommodation administration. Visit dorm administration on dorm 3, floor 1, to clarify the cleaning time for your room.",
    "generated_answer": "To answer the query, we need to find the relevant information from the context files. We can use keywords or phrases to locate the answer. For example, we can look for \"dorm\", \"cleaned\", or \"schedule\".\n\nWe can see that the first context file has a sentence that mentions dorm rooms and cleaning:\n\nCleaning schedule is planned by accommodation administration. To clarify the cleaning time of your room, please visit dorm administration: dorm 3, floor 1.\n\nThis sentence tells us that the cleaning schedule varies depending on the dorm and the floor, and we need to go to the dorm administration office to find out the exact time. However, this does not answer the query directly, so we need to look for more information.\n\nWe can see that the second context file has a sentence that mentions the reception days and times:\n\nReception days:  \nTuesday: 10:00-13:30  \nWednesday: 14:00-17:00  \nThursday: 10:00-13:30  \nFriday: 14:00-16:30\n\nThis sentence tells us that the academic transcripts are issued in room 432, and we can infer that this is the location of the dorm administration office. However, this does not answer the query either, so we need to look for more information.\n\nWe can see that there is no other relevant information in the context files, so we have to make an educated guess based on the available data. We can assume that the cleaning schedule is similar for all dorms and floors, and that the reception days and times are the same for all academic transcript requests. Therefore, we can conclude that the dorm rooms are cleaned according to the reception days and times, and that the students need to visit room 432 on any of those days to find out their cleaning time.\n\n### Final answer: The dorm rooms are cleaned on the same days as the academic transcript requests, which are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Students need to visit room 432 to find out their cleaning time."

Then you can use the printer on the same floor to print the file.
