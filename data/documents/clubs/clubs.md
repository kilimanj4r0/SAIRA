# Clubs
* **You'll learn more about yourself**  
Joining a student organization contributes to your self-awareness, as well as presents many opportunities to learn more about yourself, your goals, and your strengths. You can learn from how other students handle certain situations and test your current knowledge.
* **You'll develop soft skills**  
Soft skills are essentially "people skills" â€” they're the skills that allow us to effectively interact with others, like communication, attitude, team work and work ethic. Participating in a student organization not only teaches you these skills, but also helps you broaden and improve those you already have.
* **You'll get networking opportunities.**  
Another great benefit of student clubs & societies is that you get the opportunity to network. Meeting new students, making connections, and building relationships will all help down the line when you're looking for a job.
* **You'll gain practical experience**  
Participating in a club or an organization based around your particular area of study will give you practical experience within that field. And what's great about student clubs is that while you learn to use skills - you get to test them out in a safe environment where making mistakes is OK.
* **You'll learn how to engage with diverse groups of people.**  
Learning how different people respond and react to certain situations will help you develop your skills in presenting and implementing ideas.
* **You'll get a break from your studies**  
Concentrating on studying is obviously important, but giving your mind a break is necessary (and beneficial). While taking part in club activities, you'll be able to socialize with like-minded individuals and learn as much from them as you would from the book.
* **You'll expand your CV**  
There's no arguing that experience looks good on a CV. Showing employers that you participated in, or even lead, a student club will indicate that you're ambitious, broad-minded and active person who likes taking most from available opportunities.
* **You'll be able to give back to the University**  
Being part of student club environment and culture, you subconsciously contribute to university development. You set standards and build future legacy by being an active member of the campus.
* **You'll have fun!**   
Another simple reason to join a student club is to have fun. Meeting new people, making new friends, and participating in activities will help you enjoy your stay at Innopolis University.
