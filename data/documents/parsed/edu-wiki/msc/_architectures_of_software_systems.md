Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


Modern software systems are complex and their development require a deep knowledge of how to control the growing complexity starting from correct choices in the architectural design. The Course is a reflection on the comprehensive approach to modern software architectural design to stimulate the SW engineers sensitivity to the robustness and the resilience of the applications. Software engineering and software architecture concepts will be deconstructed and reconstructed considering well-known and innovative approaches used in the real world to manufacture software solutions through lectures and practical activities. The students will develop real applications on the subject of project courses assigned to different competing teams. Individual contributions will be evaluated as well as the participation in teamwork.
