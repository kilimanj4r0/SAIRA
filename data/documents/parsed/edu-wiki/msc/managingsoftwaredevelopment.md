Course characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* People Management
* Processes and Software Development Life-cycles
* Planning and Controlling


### What is the purpose of this course?


Large scale software development requires the ability to manage resources - both human and computational - through control of the development process. This course is a breadth oriented course, designed to help technically-trained software engineers to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to lead a project team, understand the relationship of software development to overall project engineering, estimate time and costs, and understand the software process. The nature of software development is sufficiently unique to require specialized management techniques, especially in the areas of the estimating and scheduling.



### Course Objectives Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students will remember:



* importance of people in software development
* trade-offs in various managing style
* importance to manage customer expectations
* major differences in the software development process
* several methods to plan projects and estimate their duration


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to describe and explain (with examples)



* Impact of different personality types on team performance
* Strengths and weaknesses of specific software development processes
* Ways to define the project success criteria and potential risks
* Customer oriented work breakdown and planning


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to



* Apply critical reasoning to assess root-causes of problems in software development process
* Select a right process of a particular software development project
* Define the success thresholds.
* Evaluate and manage risks
* Estimate project duration with several methods
* Communicate with customers on the project related matters.
