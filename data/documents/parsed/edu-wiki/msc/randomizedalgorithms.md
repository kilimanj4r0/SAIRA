Course outline
--------------


This course covers basic concepts in the design and analysis of randomized algorithms focusing on statistical techniques used in science and industry. The goal of the course is to show the power of randomized algorithms and its applications. Topics include: Hypothesis testing and estimation, game theoretic techniques, graph algorithms, non-parametric statistics, analysis of variance, decision theory, and Bayesian statistics.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


* Students are able to measure randomness of given algorithms.
* Students can predict how the randomness affects behaviors of algorithms.
* Students can derandomize algorithms, i.e., extract deterministic instances.


Required background knowledge
-----------------------------


Solid knowledge of data structures and algorithms, number theory, and good programming skills are assumed.



Prerequisite courses
--------------------


It is recommended to pass Advanced Statistics course before Randomized Algorithms course to be familiar with probability and statistics.
