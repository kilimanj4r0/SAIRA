3. Bug Bounty programs
 |
| Linux security | 1. Keep it all together and see how Linux kernel deals with that.
2. SELinux
3. GrSec patches
4. Why Linux is not safety system
 |


Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


The main purpose of this course is to give students a security vision from up to down, because the security principle of weakest link insist that the weakest part of the process/system would be the one to be attacked. 



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Remember main security principles
* List SDL stages
* Describe the difference between security and safety
* Explain basic binary vulnerabilities
* Specify the required security assurance
* Describe the key elements of SOC systems
* Explain why fuzzing is not the same as unit or integration testing


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Perform Threat Modeling
* Review code to find insecure patterns
* Deal with open source code securely
* Explain the value of bug bounty programme and find the right moment to start it


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Suggest hardenings and architecture drifts to achieve required level of s&s
* Propose process improvement in a cost-effective manner that would drastically improve the security and safety level.

### Recommendations for students on how to succeed in the course


Participation is important. Showing up is the key to success in this course.  
If you don’t have a corresponding technical background, please do not hesitate to ask lecturer. If you feel that the gap is deep, request for extra reading.  
Reading the recommended literature is optional, and will give you a deeper understanding of the material.
