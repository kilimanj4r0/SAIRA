Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


Offensive Technology introduces methods, tools, and techniques to the students to assess the security of different services, protocols, and applications. The course aims to expose the students to real-world expertise from a security perspective and let them find vulnerabilities in both software and hardware, Also in this course, the students will learn how to analyze a malicious application and how they can understand the behavior of this application and deploy the appropriate defenses against this application. Furthermore, the students will develop projects of their choice to show their skills. In this course, the students will particularly focus on Software Testing, Fuzzing, Malware Analysis, Mobile Security, and Network and Web Security.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Common weaknesses/vulnerabilities in web application
* ASLR, NX, and how are these techniques can help to protect against a malicious attacker
* Fuzzing techniques
* Malware C&C server
* Process injection techniques that are used in malware and how to defend against it
* Mobile security analysis


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Methods and techniques bypass memory mitigation techniques
* Methods and techniques for fuzz testing
* Methods and techniques malware analysis
* Methods and techniques for mobile security testing
* Methods and techniques web penetration testing


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Perform a network discovery
* Detect/exploit common weaknesses/vulnerabilities in web applications.
* Detect vulnerabilities in software.
* Writing an exploit to bypass ASLR and NX protection.
* Perform fuzzing for a specific use case.
* Perform security assessment for mobile application
* Perform security analysis for a malicious application
