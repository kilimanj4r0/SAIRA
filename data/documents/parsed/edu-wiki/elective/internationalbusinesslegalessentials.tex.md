This is a highly practical course in International Business Law. During this course the students have the opportunity to travel the path of a small or medium-size enterprise from set-up/start-up, to launching and growing the business and exiting. The students not only get an insight about the legal issues that come along this way, but also are provided with some hints on how to overcome these legal challenges.
