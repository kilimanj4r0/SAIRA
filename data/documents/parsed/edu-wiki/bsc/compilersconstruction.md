Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


The software development process and the depth of programming cannot be understood without a detailed analysis of the compilation process, from the lexical analysis to the syntactical and semantic analysis up to code generation and optimization, and without understanding both strength and limitation of this process. This course dig deeper into this topic building on the fundamental notions studied in theoretical computer science of which is the natural continuation. The typical compiler pipeline will be studied and a project will allow students to practice with the relevant tools.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Understanding in depth the compilation process
* Realizing the limits of the process and of Semantic Analysis
* Read and write grammars for programming language constructs
* Perform lexical analysis and use lexical analyzer generators
* Perform top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing and use parser generators
* Perform semantic analysis


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* How to design and develop compilers and language-related tools.
* The contents of each phase of the compilation process.
* How integrate compilers into an IDE.
* How to design a virtual machine for a language.


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* To be able to develop a language compiler.
