### What is the purpose of this course?


Introduction to Programming II is the continuation of an introductory course to programming. It teaches in a more in-depth look at programming and at the development of software. The course is project oriented and it focusses on problem-solving and how to program well. Students will learn how to master the fundamental control structures, data structures, reasoning patterns and programming language mechanisms characterizing modern programming, as well as the fundamental rules of producing high-quality software. The course also introduces functional programming.
