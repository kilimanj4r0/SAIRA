Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


The course is designed to provide Software Engineers and Computer Scientists by knowledge of basic (core) concepts, definitions, theoretical results and techniques of ordinary differential equations theory, basics of power series and numerical methods, applications of the all above in sciences. All definitions and theorem statements (that will be given in lectures and that are needed to explain the keywords listed above) will be formal, but just few of these theorems will be proven formally. Instead (in the tutorial and practice classes) we will try these definitions and theorems on work with routine exercises and applied problems.
