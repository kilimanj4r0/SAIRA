### Late Submission Policy


This policy will be strictly applied in this course. Should a personal emergency arise that affects your ability to turn in an assignment in a timely fashion, you must contact the course instructor BEFORE the deadline to get a “Late Submission Approval” from the course instructor. Documents that prove the urgency of your situation must be submitted to your instructor, e.g., health reports.

The policy applies to graded assignments only.



### Cooperation Policy and Quotations


We encourage vigorous discussion and cooperation in this class. You should feel free to discuss any aspects of the class with any classmates. However, we insist that any written material that is not specifically designated as a Team Deliverable be done by you alone. This includes answers to reading questions, individual reports associated with assignments, and labs. We also insist that if you include verbatim text from any source, you clearly indicate it using standard conventions of quotation or indentation and a note to indicate the source.

| **Criterion** | **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task Response (Analysis Quality and Structure) (25%)
 | The essay has all the five paragraphs in accordance with the RRE structure, with clear Introductory and Concluding paragraphs. The RRE summary clearly identifies the author’s thesis and paraphrases the major points in the author’s argument well and shows a sophisticated analysis of the author’s ideas. The response offers clear and concise reasons why the writer may agree or disagree with the author or how this article has increased the writer’s understanding of the topic.
 | The essay follows the five- paragraph structure of an RRE essay, but the writing may have some flaws and not have clear logic at times. Minor elements of the Introductory and Concluding paragraphs are missing. The RRE summary identifies the author’s thesis and outlines most of the article(s), but a portion of the argument may be missing.
Analysis of the ideas is not sophisticated and includes some of the primary evidence that the author has utilized to prove the thesis but may leave out other examples for exploring the thesis. The response develops one or two points very well.
 | The essay does not follow the five -paragraph structure (the paragraph order is wrong; the conclusion is missing there is a thesis, but it may be faulty), and analysis quality may not be thorough (e.g. the support is irrelevant). In addition, the writing has flaws of organization and does not have clear logic at times. Elements of the Introductory and Concluding paragraphs are missing, redundant, or irrelevant. The RRE summary identifies quite well the author’s thesis and outlines most of the article(s) but may be missing some of the argument. Analysis of the ideas is somehow superficial and includes some of the primary evidence that the author has utilized to prove the thesis but leaves out other examples for exploring the thesis. The response develops one or two points well.
 | Several paragraphs are missing. There is no thesis statement.
The support is not relevant or detailed enough in most parts. The writing has serious flaws of organization, and its logic is difficult to follow. Introductory and Concluding paragraphs are poorly developed with much essential information missing. The RRE summary does not identify the author’s thesis and does not outline most of the articles. The essay lacks clear arguments and uses simple language. Analysis of the ideas is superficial and includes poor evidence of what the author has utilized to prove the thesis.
Despite the presence of the Reference List, the essay lacks essential elements and cannot be classified as an RRE.
 |
| Academic Writing Style(10%)
 | The student has followed Academic Writing Style rules. The student has avoided overgeneralization, redundancy, ineffective nominalizations, ineffective passive, charged language and wordiness. The student used effective subjects and verbs.

 | The student is not aware of the Academic Writing Style.
 |
| Coherence & Cohesion (25%)
 | Uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately. Presents a clear central topic within each paragraph.
 | Uses cohesive devices effectively, but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical
 | Makes inadequate, inaccurate or over- use of cohesive devices. May be repetitive because of the lack of referencing and substitution.

communication. The student uses a mix of simple and complex sentence forms. Makes some errors in grammar and punctuation, but they rarely reduce overall communication.
 | The student uses a limited range of vocabulary, and it is often irrelevant to the task. May make noticeable errors in spelling and/or word formation that may
cause difficulty for the reader in
comprehending the text. Errors sometimes impede communication.
The student uses a limited range of sentence structures, attempts to write complex sentences but these tend to be less accurate than simple sentences. May make frequent grammatical errors, and punctuation may be
faulty; errors can cause some difficulty for the reader.

 | The student has tried to paraphrase the information necessary to sustain his/her ideas but has not always
succeeded in doing this. In-text referencing is not well done, quotations do not include the full quote and author tags are mainly
missing.
