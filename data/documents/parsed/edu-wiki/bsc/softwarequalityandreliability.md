Software Quality and Reliability
================================


* **Course name:** Software Quality and Reliability
* **code:** 000000517


Course characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Quality Models and Metrics
* Verification Techniques and Testing
* Adequacy Criteria
* Reliability Engineering
* Cost of quality


### What is the purpose of this course?


Building high-quality software is utmost important. However, it is easier said than done. The course is an overview of software quality and software reliability engineering methods. It includes introduction to software quality, overview of static analysis methods, testing techniques and reliability engineering. The students will put in practice the methods during laboratory classes and will dig down the topics in a small realistic project. The course balances traditional lectures, laboratory class and a small course project in which students apply the concepts and methods they learn to real artifacts. The course project consists in a quality analysis of an open source project of student’s choice.
