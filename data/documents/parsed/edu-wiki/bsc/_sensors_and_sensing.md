Course Characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Physical principles for sensors and sensing
* Basics of error analysis and calibration
* Sensor’s data processing and filtering


### What is the purpose of this course?


This course covers selected topics in sensors and sensing area, which are in particular important for robotic application. The students are expected to learn the course topics on their own beyond the level of the lectures. The goals throughout the course are to refresh students’ math skills in data and error analysis, and familiarize them with sensing principles and sensor utilization, giving them both analytic and experimental experience. The students will be required to participate in laboratory practicum and solve practical tasks on data processing in MATLAB/Python/C++ environment.
