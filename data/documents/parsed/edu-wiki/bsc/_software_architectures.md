Software Architectures
======================


* **Course name:** Software Architectures
* **Course number:** XYZ
* **Subject area:** Software Engineering


Course characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Introduction to software architecture
* Steps to follow while working with software architecture
* Key architectural patterns
* How to describe software architecture?
* UML as a language for the software architecture


### What is the purpose of this course?


Software developers often follow architectural and design patterns informally without a deep understanding of the subject. This prevents the delivered software to work optimally and often to meet functional and nonfunctional requirements. The course provides a detailed understanding of software architectures and how they should be used by software developers and in the software engineering process.



### Course Objectives Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


* Learn how to design high quality software meeting requirements
* Learn how architectural issues can impact software design
* key architectural patterns and their properties


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


* Understand the principles and foundations of software architectures
* Understanding architecture patterns and their use
* Understand formal notations and specifications with related tools


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


* Understand the task and select the proper architecture of the system
* Use particular design tool to create and update architecture of the system

If necessary, please indicate freely your course’s features in terms of students’ performance assessment:



#### Labs/seminar classes:


* In-class participation 1 point for each individual contribution in a class but not more than 1 point a week (i.e. 14 points in total for 14 study weeks),
* overall course contribution (to accumulate extra-class activities valuable to the course progress, e.g. a short presentation, book review, very active in-class participation, etc.) up to 6 points.


#### Interim performance assessment:


* in-class tests up to 10 points for each test (i.e. up to 40 points in total for 2 theory and 2 practice tests),
* computational practicum assignment up to 10 points for each task (i.e. up to 30 points for 3 tasks).


#### Exams:


* mid-term exam up to 25 points,
* final examination up to 25 points.


#### Overall score:


100 points (100%).
