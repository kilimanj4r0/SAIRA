Course outline
--------------


Advance Algorithms is a fundamental and important part of computer engineering. This course introduces different methodologies used to solve real world problems. Limitations on solving problems efficiently are also analyzed critically, with emphasis on NP-Complete problems and the theory of complexity. In depth coverage will be made regarding Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms. We shall try to solve various problems using different techniques and shall establish important relationships between algorithms belonging to different categories.
