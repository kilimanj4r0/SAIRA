Tools and resources for teaching
================================


Several organizational aspects to figure out:


1. Moodle Access


We use [Moodle](https://moodle.innopolis.university) as our LMS. Here are the tutorials explaining how to work with it:

* [Recommendation for setting the final grades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSq_2mjYghE)


For any questions in regards to Moodle you can contact [Rinat Akhmetzianov](https://portal.university.innopolis.ru/company/personal/user/4117/).


2. Remote teaching


In some groups, we have students who are authorized to attend lessons online. In this case, you need to use a video conference system. It is recommended to use Microsoft Teams, but it is up to you to use your preferred software for this purpose. Just remember, students should have clear algorithms for joining the lesson together with the tools needed. For those not familiar with any video conference system, we recommend using Microsoft Teams:

3. Attendance tracking


We use automatic authentication software [BAAM](https://baam.duckdns.org/) compatible with Moodle to simplify the process of attendance tracking. Watch the video below to see how it works:
