Logic and Discrete Mathematics (Philosophy 1)
=============================================


* **Course name**: Logic and Discrete Mathematics (Philosophy 1)
* **Code discipline**: CSE113
* **Subject area**: Math, Computer Science


Short Description
-----------------


This course consists of two distinct but overlapping parts: i. Logic; and ii. Discrete Mathematics.
The first part of the course is an introduction to formal symbolic logic. Philosopher John Locke once wrote that ``logic is the anatomy of thought. *This part of the course will teach* 
students to analyse and evaluate arguments using the formal techniques of modern symbolic logic.
The second part of the is designed for students to teach them basic notions of graph theory, discrete optimization and dynamic programming. This part will give practical experience with basic algorithms in discrete mathematics.

During such comprehensive oral/written the student could be asked to solve exercises and to explain theoretical and practical aspects of the course.
