Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


Have you ever wondered about how computers decide on what your credit worthiness is, or how they can play chess as good as a world master, or how world class circuits can be built with a minimal number of crossed wires? Perhaps you have wanted to build a human like robot, or have wanted to explore the stars with automated probes. Artificial Intelligence is the field which examines such problems. The goal is to provide a diverse theoretical overview of historical and current thought in the realm of Artificial Intelligence, Computational Intelligence, Robotics and Machine Learning Techniques.

### Final assessment


**Section 1**



1. Apply the PEAS model to a real world instance.
2. You have a classification problem involving images, from the perspective of Plato and Aristotle on knowledge, which algorithm would they implement, justify your decision.
3. Write a short essay based upon either the prosecution or defense of a trial of an Android who has passed the Turing test who is petitioning the court for human rights. What would be your case for or against using concepts in class such as Turing test, Chinese room, etc.?


**Section 2**



1. Here is an example family tree. Given a simple Prolog Query - what would be the result?
2. Here is an example logic problem. Given a Prolog Query - what would be the result.
3. Compare and Contrast two different search algorithms in terms of time and space complexity
4. Given data of type X, what search algorithm should you use and why?


**Section 3**
