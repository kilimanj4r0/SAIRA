Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


The main purpose of this course is to teach students to collect the product data, analyze it and make metrics-based decisions. Students will learn the tools for gathering and analyzing data and get the practice of applying this knowledge in simulated practical classes as well as in their research projects.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Metrics and indicators required to assess the effectiveness of a product;
* Tools for collecting and analyzing product metrics and indicators;
* Decision making methods based on the analysis of a product metrics and indicators;


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Ability to measure and manage economic efficiency of a business;
* Creating data acquisition models for analyzing products metrics;
* Calculating unit economics;
* Ability to use a cohort analysis of user behavior;
* Ability to specify key and secondary indicators for the business and work with them in dynamics;
* Ability to make metric-based decisions;


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Calculating and analyzing product metrics;
* Identifying growth drivers - levers of influence over the product economic success of the product;
* Defining a business unit for calculating indicators and a sales funnel;
* Researching the client's traffic funnel, identifying weak points in it and the ways to eliminate them;
* Identifying business bottlenecks based on key product metrics;
* Presenting the results of business research;
