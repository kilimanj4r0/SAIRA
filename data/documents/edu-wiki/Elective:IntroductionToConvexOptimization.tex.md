Introduction to Convex Optimization
===================================


This is all-covering review course on "typical" optimization methods. During the course, students learn fundamental principles and algorithms of numerical optimization. The principles cover wide range of optimization methods, from basic (gradient-like) to advanced ones. Students learn how to choose appropriate method depending on given problem. The course also provide problem solving and programming experience.
