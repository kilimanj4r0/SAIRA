Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


Inter-Networking and Routing is the course for SNE program that provides the students with fundamental knowledge about inter-networking and routing. The course starts with some introductory material about routing, such as the definition of path cost and the classification of routing algorithms. A networking infrastructure deploys various algorithms for routing packets, classified as those using optimal routes and those using non-optimal routes. This course includes hands-on exercise, and the students will practice their skills on the actual hardware and software. This course includes various interesting topics in the networking domain, which are also related to real-world applications. This course will particularly focus on addressing in detail routing, detailed BGP, OSPF, and AODV. Furthermore, this course also covers Network Address Translation (NAT), Quality of Service (QoS) fundamentals, as well as Virtual LAN (VLAN). It additionally discusses the network traffic, it is monitoring, proxying, and packet crafting in detail. Students will have the opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in class to actual hardware. Furthermore, this course also includes invited talks by experts from industry which will help students to have knowledge of the current state of the art.
