Distributed Systems
===================


* **Course name**: Distributed Systems
* **Code discipline**: CSE 506
* **Subject area**: Computer Science Fundamentals


Short Description
-----------------


This is an introductory course in distributed systems. During the course, students will learn the fundamental principles and techniques that can be applied to design and develop distributed systems and will cover architectures of distributed systems, communication, naming, fault tolerance, consistency replication, virtualization, and security. In addition, we will discuss different aspects of the design and implementation of popular distributed systems programming models and consensus algorithms (Raft and Paxos). The course will not only cover computer science-related topics but will also include a substantial part of software engineering activities.

### Recommendations for students on how to succeed in the course


Participation is important. Showing up is the key to success in this course.  
You will work in teams, so coordinating teamwork will be an important factor for success. This is also reflected in the peer review being a graded item.  
Review lecture materials before classes to do well in quizzes.  
Reading the recommended literature is optional, and will give you a deeper understanding of the material.

### Final assessment


**Section 1**



1. Can be a final exam, project defense, or some other equivalent of the final exam.
2. For the final assessment, students present the project work they have accomplished during the course.


**Section 2**


**Section 3**


  




### The retake exam


**Section 1**



1. For the retake, students have to implement a project and take the exam if they failed in both components. The complexity of the project can be reduced if it is one person working on it. The grading criteria for each section are the same as for the final project presentation. There has to be a meeting before the retake itself.
2. P7. Activities and Teaching Methods by Sections
3. Mark what techniques and methods are used in each section (1 is used, 0 is not used).
