Analysis of Software Artifacts

* **Code discipline**:
* **Subject area**: Computer Science Fundamentals


Short Description
-----------------


Building Software quality is a key aspect of any IT solution whether a few hundred lines of code for a
smart phone app or a few million lines of code for Enterprise Resource Planning software.
The Analysis of Software Artifacts course provides techniques to develop confidence in the
quality of the software being produced or acquired regardless of its size and domain. The
course adopts the view that software quality is not only the absence of defects but that it
encompasses all the characteristics that bear on the ability of the software to satisfy stated and
implied needs. Software quality is then defined from different perspectives: product quality,
quality in use and process quality through the use of specific quality models. The course
systematically explores different quality attributes and the techniques most appropriate to
verify them. Specific topics include software testing, static analysis and model checking,
inspections, technical debt, cost of software quality, planning for quality, quantitative models
and defect classifications. The course balances traditional lectures with small projects in
which students apply the ideas they are learning to real artifacts. The group project consists on
the preparation of a quality plan for an industry project. The final assessment is done at the hackathon where student teams evaluate quality of an open source software component per request of an industrial “customer”.

### Final assessment


**Section 1**



1. Can be a final exam, project defense, or some other equivalent of the final exam.
2. The course conducts a hackathon with industrial “customers” who are interested in evaluating the quality of a particular open source software component. Student teams are invited to analyze the quality of those components and deliver a presentation. The cases coming from the industry are very different, however may group the criteria in the following order:
3. (40pt) Understanding the business context through the Quality Model
4. Interview the customer
5. Define the most critical quality requirements based on the examples from the Quality
6. Model
7. Understand the priorities of the quality requirements
8. (40pt) Findings and soundness of analysis by applying adequate methods
9. Map the quality requirements and analysis methods
10. Conduct the analysis by investigating the project repository, running static analysis for metrics, checking and running the available tests, conducting exploratory testing, running random testing or others.
11. (20pt) Presentation quality
12. Summarize your findings in the form of a presentation.
13. Make it clear, what the highest priority quality requirements for the customer are
14. Make it clear, what the most adequate methods to analyze the quality requirements are
15. Show the soundness of you findings

**Section 3**


  




### The retake exam


**Section 1**



1. The retake takes the form of an oral exam based on the material taught in class as well as an individual project that follows the lab's material. Students need to demonstrate understanding of the course material and apply what they learned in an individual prototype project. The grading criteria for each section are the same as for the final project presentation. There has to be a meeting before the retake itself to plan and agree on the project ideas, and to answer questions.
2. P7. Activities and Teaching Methods by Sections
3. Mark what techniques and methods are used in each section (1 is used, 0 is not used).
