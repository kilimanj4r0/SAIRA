### Recommendations for students on how to succeed in the course


Participation is important. Showing up is the key to success in this course.  
You will work in teams, so coordinating teamwork will be an important factor for success. This is also reflected in the peer review being a graded item.  
Review lecture materials before classes to do well in quizzes.  
Reading the recommended literature is optional, and will give you a deeper understanding of the material.
