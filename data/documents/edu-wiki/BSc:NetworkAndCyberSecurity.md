Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


Security breaches cost billions of dollars worth of damage to the computing industry. Today, cybercriminals control armies consisting of several millions of compromised machines. Attacks are increasingly being perpetrated towards enterprises, individuals, critical infrastructure and even governments. At the same time, our computer systems and platforms are fast evolving to meet the demands of the industry. Increasing the use of personalized devices, and our growing dependence on legacy computer systems that weren’t designed with security in mind is a challenge ahead. Therefore, the purpose of this course is to cover the design and implementation of different IT systems from a security perspective. This course introduces to the field of systems security: that is, how to analyze and develop secure systems. The course covers fundamental concepts of systems design, low and high-level vulnerabilities exploitation, design, and implementation flaws in different types of applications based on the real-world scenarios.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Security policies and controls
* Risks and threats related to the system design and its implementation
* Software security testing methodologies
* Software development security techniques
* Injection and authorization flaws
* Cookies and misconfiguration flaws
* Common weaknesses/vulnerabilities in web applications
* Common weaknesses/vulnerabilities in the typical systems software


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Information security management methods
* Difference between different types of risks and threats
* Security-related web technologies
* The difference in the different web application flaws
* ASLR, NX and how are these techniques can help to protect against a malicious attacker
* Covert channels
* Networking tools
* Network proxies


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Critically audit systems and code for security flaws and threats
* Design and implement exploits for real security vulnerabilities
* Develop secure systems and applications
* Be able to design defense solutions and outline their limitations
* Be able to find misconfigurations/vulnerabilities in a given network/system
