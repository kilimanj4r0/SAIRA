Course outline
--------------


The software development process and the depth of programming cannot be understood without a detailed analysis of the compilation process, from the lexical analysis to the syntactical and semantic analysis up to code generation and optimization, and without understanding both strength and limitation of this process. This course dig deeper into this topic building on the fundamental notions studied in theoretical computer science of which is the natural continuation. The typical compiler pipeline will be studied and a project will allow students to practice with the relevant tools.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


* Understanding in depth the compilation process
* Realizing the limits of the process and of Semantic Analysis
* Read and write grammars for programming language constructs
