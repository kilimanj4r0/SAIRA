Course Characteristics
----------------------


What subject area does your course (discipline) belong to?
----------------------------------------------------------


Robotic control; Artificial Intelligence; Cognitive Science; Machine Learning.



### Key concepts of the class


* Behavior and cognition as complex dynamical systems
* Embodied cognition
* Machine learning methods for robotics


### What is the purpose of this course?


The course illustrates the fundamental principles of robotics with particular reference to autonomous robotics: embodiment and situatedness, morphological computation, sensory-motor coordination, robustness, emergence, multi-levels and multi-scale organizations, compositionality, integration between behavioral and cognitive skill, anticipation, and internal models. Students will learn how to program robots and how to design robots that develop their behavioral and cognitive skills autonomously, in interaction with the environment, through evolutionary and reinforcement learning algorithms. This will be realized through the illustration of concrete examples taken from state of the art research and through practical experimentation carried in simulation.



### Course objectives based on Bloom’s taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to remember and recognize



* What makes situated and embodied system different from other AI applications
* The importance of sensory-motor coordination and morphological computation
* The advantage and drawbacks of adaptive methods and of methods based on hand-design
* The open research issues in autonomous robotics


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to describe and explain



* The importance of the interaction between the body of the robot, the controller of the robot and the environment
* The multi-level and multi-scale organzation of behavior and cognition
* The characteristics of evolutionary, reinforcement learning, and learning by demonstration methods
* The relation of the methods above with supervised learning methods
* The methods that can support long-term adaptation and the synthesis of complex solutions


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to



* Design a controller for a mobile robot capable to perform a simple task
* Evolve a robot for the ability to perform a task by using evolutionary algorithm
* Train a robot for the ability to perform a task by using reinforcement learning algorithm
* Understand applicability of these methods for other sequential decision problems (e.g. recomendation systems, chatbots, educational technologies ext)
