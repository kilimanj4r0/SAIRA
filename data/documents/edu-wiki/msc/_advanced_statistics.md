Short Description
-----------------


This course in advanced statistics with a view toward applications in data sciences. It is intended for masters students who are looking to expand their knowledge of theoretical methods used in modern research in data sciences. The course presents some of the key probabilistic methods and results that may form an essential mathematical toolbox for a data scientist. This course places particular emphasis on random vectors, random matrices, and random projections. It teaches basic theoretical skills for the analysis of these objects, which include concentration inequalities, covering and packing arguments, decoupling and symmetrization tricks, chaining and comparison techniques for stochastic processes, combinatorial reasoning based on the VC dimension, and a lot more. This course integrates theory with applications for covariance estimation, semidefinite programming, networks, elements of statistical learning, error correcting codes, clustering, matrix completion, dimension reduction, sparse signal recovery, sparse regression, and more.

Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


The main purpose of this course is to present the fundamentals of high-dimensional statistics with applications to data science. The course presents some of the key probabilistic methods and results that may form an essential mathematical toolbox for a data scientist. This course places particular emphasis on random vectors, random matrices, and random projections. This course integrates theory with applications for covariance estimation, semidefinite programming, networks, elements of statistical learning, error correcting codes, clustering, matrix completion, dimension reduction, sparse signal recovery, sparse regression, and more.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Explain the difference between low-dimensional and high-dimensional data
* Explain concentration inequalities and their application
* Remember the main statistical properties of high-dimensional vectors and matrices


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Perform basic Monte Carlo computations, such as Monte Carlo integration
* Obtain simple but accurate bounds of complex statistical metrics
* Apply the median of means estimator
* Investigate simple statistics of social networks
* Exploit the thin-shell phenomenon when analysing data
* Apply data clustering and dimension reduction


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* To understand the problems related to statistical analysis of data.
* To apply theoretical statistics in real-life via computer simulations and thereby confirm or reject the correctness of the theoretical concepts.
* To identify the correct statistical methods that needs to be applied to data in order to solve the given tasks in real-life.
* To be able to generate and run experiments on random data samples.
