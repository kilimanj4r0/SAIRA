Security of systems and networks
================================


* **Course name:** Security of systems and networks (SSN)
* **Course number:** SNE-08


  




Course characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Applied cryptography
* Security protocols
* Network and Internet security
* Authentication and Authorization
* Software Security


### What is the purpose of this course?


This course will cover the fundamentals of security, security protocols, and their
applications in real-world. The topics covered in this course include applied
cryptography, authentication, passwords, practical security, social aspects of
security, SSL/TLS, email security, PKI, and IPSec. Furthermore, this course
will strengthen the security knowledge of the students and guide them in the
right direction for their upcoming research projects and advanced courses. The
course is divided into two parts. The first part will cover the theory and hands-on practice of the concepts taught at class. And the second part of the course
will focus on the course projects. The student will work on a security project
by using the concepts taught in the class.
