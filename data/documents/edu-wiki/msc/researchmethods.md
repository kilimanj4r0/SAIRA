Research Methods
================


* **Course name:** Research Methods
* **Course number:** XYZ


Course Characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Definition and types of research
* Review process
* Scientific fraud
* Experimental design


  




### What is the purpose of this course?


The main purpose of this course is to present the research methods and concepts to the master students of Innopolis University of Data Science and Robotics programs. On one side the course provides the scientific fundamentals of the research activity and on the other anchors the theoretical concepts on practices coming from the world of software development and engineering. As a result of the course, students demonstrate on practice the acquired skills of formulating the research problem, collecting, analyzing data and presenting results of research.



### Course objectives based on Bloom’s taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to:



* Remember the steps of research design
* Remember the sources of information in Software Engineering
* Remember the concept of measurement
* Remember the notion of Scientific fraud
* Explain the difference between 4different experimentation designs


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to understand:



* The difference between Science and Engineering
* The nature of errors
* The ethics in research
* How to choose the papers
* How to summarize the research paper
* How to evaluate the research paper


  




### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Summarize a research paper
* Evaluate a research paper
* Write good papers
* Present results of the research


  




### Course evaluation




Course grade breakdown
|  |  | **Points** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paper review1 | 10
 |
| Project proposal2 | 40
 |
| Interim performance assessment (class participation)
 | 10
 |
| Final presentation3 | 40
 |


1Students have to perform the review of the selected paper. Use the table to submit your selection and get approval for it.


2Students have to make a half-page proposal on the project in their research domain.


3At the end of the course, students make a 15-min video presentation of their research.


Each component will be assessed on a scale 0-10, where 6 is the minimum passing grade. In case of exceptional work a 10 cum laude will be assigned, with a numeric value from 10 to 13 at the discretion of the instructor. 


The grading, though, is not a simple linear combination of the components above. In particular:



* failing any part of the evaluation will trigger a failure in the entire course,
* if there are not failing components, the final grade will be computed as a weighted average of the components above approximated at the highest second digit and then rounded to the closest integer.


### Retakes


Retakes will be run as comprehensive oral exam, where the student will be assessed the acquired knowledge coming from the textbooks, the lectures, the labs, and the additional required reading material, as supplied by the instructor. During such comprehensive oral the student could be asked to solve exercises and to explain theoretical and practical aspects of the course.



### Grades range




Course grading range
|  | **Range** |
| --- | --- |
| A. Excellent
 | 95-100
 |
| B. Good
 | 75-94
 |
| C. Satisfactory
 | 55-74
 |
| D. Poor
 | 0-54
 |
