Formal Software Development of Android Apps
===========================================


The quality of a large extent of todayâ€™s software systems depends on the skills and experience of Software Engineers rather than on the use of unambiguous technologies. Many practitioners working at software companies are starting to use formal software development alternatives to build software that ensure reliable and correct behavior of applications. These alternatives are based on the use of mathematical models to guide software development. This course covers conceptual and practical underpinnings for formal software development. The course is project base: students use formal methods techniques to develop the core functionality of an Android app.
