The fourth industrial revolution of an IT based society creates many entrepreneurial opportunities. In addition, complex global challenges like internet security, sustainable business, energy supply, agglomeration, affordable health care require entrepreneurial solutions. Therefore, the study of entrepreneurship is on the rise across the globe and many high-skilled students start ambitious ventures to take advantage of these global opportunities. In addition, most larger firms change their business practices to foster intrapreneurship: the entrepreneurial behaviour of their employees. This course offers a toolbox for both start-up entrepreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship from an international perspective.
