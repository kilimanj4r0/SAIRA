General information about elective courses
==========================================


### What is an elective course?


An elective is a course chosen by students based on their interest. 


There are two types of electives: technical and humanities. Some of the electives we have offered during the last couple of years are:



* Technical Electives: <https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/List_of_BSc_Technical_Electives>
* Humanities Electives: <https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/List_of_BSc_Humanitarian_Electives>


### What should be the content of an elective course?


The content and topics can be suggested by the instructor who is delivering the course. If you are hesitating as to what exactly to offer we can help you out. 


Generally speaking, we welcome industry-related subjects. The main criteria are two:



1. subjects have to be suitable for students given their background;
2. subjects must not repeat the core subjects that students take during their degree. (See: core subjects by each year BSc & MS)


Some subjects of interest to our students could be:



1. Industrial Programming in Java;
2. Backend Development with Kotlin;
3. Advanced С++: New Language Concepts, Features and Mechanisms;
4. UX/UI design;
5. Back-end development with Python.


Example subjects we are already delivering:



1. Introduction to Quantum Programming;
2. Front-end Web Development;
3. Programming in Haskell;
4. Introduction to Game Development;
5. iOS Development with Swift;
6. Cross-platform Mobile Development with Flutter.


### How many classes/teaching hours does a course take?


A technical elective course is 40 academic hours of teaching, i.e. 20 classes (90 minutes each). These 20 classes can be a mix of lectures and labs, i.e. theory and practice, or any other contact format (masterclasses, presentations, training, …). 
In addition to that the students are expected to have 140 academic hours for self-studying work (homeworks, projects, assignments, reading, etc) and the exam including preparation. 


A humanities elective is 30 academic hours of teaching (lectures and labs) and extra 42 academic hours for a student’s self-study (homeworks, projects, assignments, reading, etc).



### What is the language of teaching?


English.



The students attending the course
=================================


### How large are the groups of students?


Number of students at an elective course is between 6 and 30. Also, the instructor can indicate the optimal number of students for their course.



### What is their background?


You can familiarize yourself with their educational program and core courses here:



* Bachelors <https://eduwiki.innopolis.university/index.php/BSc:Syllabi_Table>

Brief answer: you will submit a CV and some other documents, then do an interview, then deliver a lecture or lab to demonstrate your teaching skills and knowledge of the subject. If all goes well, the course is approved for delivery.

2. Candidates will have a 30’ Zoom talk with senior university administrators and faculty members to discuss the course, propose ideas or clarify all the details needed.
3. Candidates will be asked to prepare a 45' lecture/research seminar on a topic of your choice for an audience of the level of the second-year undergraduate students. The lecture can be arranged via Zoom on in Innopolis University premises. This will allow the candidates to familiarize with Innopolis university processes, as well as students and staff.
