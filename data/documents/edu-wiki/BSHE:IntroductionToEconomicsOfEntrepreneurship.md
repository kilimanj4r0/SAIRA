The course provides insights into how economic conditions shape entrepreneurship and vice versa. The course starts with fundamental microeconomics (market outcomes, principal-agency, transaction costs, game theory) and then asks how this informs entrepreneurial outcomes like selection into entrepreneurship through occupational choice theory and firm and market dynamics. The course continues by discussing empirical strategies to assess entrepreneurial outcomes. After that, students continue by discussing the connection between financial structures, agency and entrepreneurial choices. Lastly, students are informed about macroeconomic outcomes of entrepreneurship and its effect on long run economic development.
