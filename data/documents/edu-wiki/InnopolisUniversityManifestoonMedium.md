Being English the officialMedium of Instruction of Innopolis University does not prevent
the use of other languages, and, in particular, Russian, in other situations where two or
more people share a common language, thus English is not necessary used in situations
like informal conversation (questions after classes...), individual office hours, private emails,
private chats.


  




Rationale
---------


Fluency in multiple languages reflects on one hand a versatile mind, on the other hand the
significant effort and dedication necessary to acquire such ability. Being multilingual is a
notable skill, no matter what set of languages is in a student’s portfolio, however English
is an important addition for every graduate. The importance of English language can be
summarized in three major points:



* English as a communication means
* English as language of employment
* English as language of science


English as a communicationmeans
-------------------------------


English is the language of international communication; speaking English increases the
chances to communicate virtually anywhere in the world in every field of knowledge. Fluency
in this language allows graduate to travel, encounter new cultures, ideas and to grow as
individual and professionals. It is the mediumfor exchanging technical knowledge as well
feelings and emotions.



English as language of employment
---------------------------------


The opportunities available on the job market today requires graduates to manage a complex
mix of soft and hard skills. Among these language skills have a primarily importance, not only
for international job market, but also for seeking high-profile employment in the Russian
Federation. All themajor companies keep indeed continuous relations with abroad institution
and engineers, manager, salesmen and every other highly-qualified specialists needs
the command of at least one foreign language, typically English. English skills are just as
desirable to employers in any country as they are to employers in English-speaking countries.
Fluency in English allows employees to attend and organize international business meetings.
Where several languages are represented, the chances are that the meeting will be conducted
in English. Employees with language skills will find themselves in a position of advantage
and will be able attending relevant gathering, therefore having the opportunity to advance
faster in the career ladder.



English as language of science
------------------------------


English is also the language of science and being fluent allows graduates to continuously
educate themselves accessing scientific literature and attending international conferences.
English is essential to pursue a scientific career and to develop the necessary network able to
develop your scientific research.



Commitment to improve language skills
-------------------------------------

specific language levels based on the specific program of enrollment. Over the period study
the English level is expected to grow. The University implements several ways to support
students in their path, some of them being:

* International projects


Exceptions
----------


Specific exceptions can be made by the Department of Education for courses that need to
comply with laws and regulations of the Russian Federation (for example “Safety”). The
University commits to provide the opportunity to learn the material of these courses to all
the international students.
In some cases, instructors who are fluent in Russian and possess the appropriate established
terminology used in Russian industry and research can familiarize students with

modern terms used at the national and international levels.

community and be competitive at the national and international level.
