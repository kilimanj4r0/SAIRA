### Recommendations for students on how to succeed in the course


Participation is important. Showing up is the key to success in this course.  
If you don’t have a corresponding technical background, please do not hesitate to ask lecturer. If you feel that the gap is deep, request for extra reading.  
Reading the recommended literature is optional, and will give you a deeper understanding of the material.
