Mathematical Analysis I
=======================


* **Course name**: Mathematical Analysis I
* **Code discipline**: CSE201
* **Subject area**: Math


Short Description
-----------------


This calculus course covers differentiation and integration of functions of one variable, with applications. The basic objective of Calculus is to relate small-scale (differential) quantities to large-scale (integrated) quantities. This is accomplished by means of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Should be understanding of the integral as a cumulative sum, of the derivative as a rate of change, and of the inverse relationship between integration and differentiation.
