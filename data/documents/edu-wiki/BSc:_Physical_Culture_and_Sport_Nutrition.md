Short Description
-----------------


This course covers the following concepts: • Optimal nutrition; • Energy balance: dietary intake and physical activity; • Nutriom – a set of essential nutrients; • Optimal nutrition under budget constraint; • Food-processing technology, genetic engineering, and new sources of food; • Digital solutions in dietary management; What is the purpose of this course?; The goal of this course is to introduce basic elements of the optimal nutrition – multi-disciplinary, multi-dimensional concept, and help students find the balance between their physiological individual requirements and food consumed daily.; Students will be provided with knowledge required to design their own personal diets, associated with their needs, depending on the level of their physical activity and health status. They will also be given an overview of food safety issues and modern food-processing technologies understanding of which will enable making conscious dietary choices.; Finally, digital tools available to assist personal food management and trends in internet-of-things (IoT) development will be discussed, offering students perspective on potential app projects in personalized nutrition.; Course Objectives Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy; What should a student remember at the end of the course?
