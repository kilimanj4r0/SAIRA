---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


The main purpose of this course is to teach students to collect the product data, analyze it and make metrics-based decisions. Students will learn the tools for gathering and analyzing data and get the practice of applying this knowledge in simulated practical classes as well as in their research projects.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Tools for collecting and analyzing product metrics and indicators;
* Decision making methods based on the analysis of product metrics and indicators.


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Creating data acquisition models for analyzing products metrics;
* Calculating unit economics;
* Ability to use a cohort analysis of user behavior;
* Ability to specify key and secondary indicators for the business and work with them in dynamics;
* Ability to make metric-based decisions.


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Designing data collection system and specifying the requirements for developers of the product;
* Researching traffic funnel – identifying weak points in it and the ways to eliminate them
* Identifying growth drivers - levers of influence over the product economic success of the product;
* Using the cohort analysis to deeper understand the results of changes in product and predicting future effects;
* Presenting the results unit-economics researches.

### Recommendations for students on how to succeed in the course


The student is recommended the following scheme of preparation for classes:  
Students can be joined to the groups to prepare and complete the course assignment.  
Teams from 2 to 5 students are allowed.  
It is possible to work with a team that is not part of the study group.  
It is highly recommended to treat the written assignments of the course as a tool to help students to make decisions about the development of their own business.  
The university classes format shouldn’t influence the students' attitude to the value of the research in business.
