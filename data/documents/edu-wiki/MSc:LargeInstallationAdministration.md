### Typical questions for ongoing performance evaluation within this section


1. What are containers? State at least three benefits of using them?
2. Why memory reclamation approaches are needed for virtual machines?
3. What are “cgroup” and “namespace” subsystems. How can we use the “cgroup” subsystem?
4. Briefly explain about the “Ballooning” approach and its working to reclaim VM memory?
5. What is a Unikernel? State at least two benefits and one drawback.


### Typical questions for seminar classes (labs) within this section


1. Validate that when a node goes down a new instance is launched. Show how the redistribution of the instances can happen when the broken node comes back alive?
2. Deploy a simple application (e.g. a simple web page showing the hostname of the host node it is running upon) for each orchestrator and validate that its instances spreads around the container farm.
3. What is the difference between simple load-balancing and HA load-balancing?
4. Install at least 4 different types of guest systems or distributions on the physical host?
5. Create a simple web page (preferably containing some pictures), construct an image with operating system you chose and deploy it via the unikernal.


### Test questions for final assessment in this section


1. State two benefits of immersion cooling over traditional air cooling in data centers?
2. State one main difference of a container from a System Virtual machine?
3. Briefly explain about Copy-on-write storage.
