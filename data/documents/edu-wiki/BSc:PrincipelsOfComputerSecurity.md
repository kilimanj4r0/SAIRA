### Typical questions for seminar classes (labs) within this section


1. In a public-key system using RSA, you intercept the ciphertext C = 10 sent to a user whose public key is e = 5, n = 35. What is the plaintext M?

### Typical questions for ongoing performance evaluation within this section


1. What characteristics are needed in a secure hash function?
2. What is the difference between weak and strong collision resistance?
3. What is the role of a compression function in a hash function?
4. It is possible to use a hash function to construct a block cipher with a structure similar to DES. Because a hash function is one way and a block cipher must be reversible (to decrypt), how is it possible?

2. For SHA-512, show the equations for the values of W16, W17, W18, and W19.


### Test questions for final assessment in this section


1. This problem introduces a hash function similar in spirit to SHA that operates on let- ters instead of binary data. It is called the toy tetragraph hash (tth).6 Given a message consisting of a sequence of letters, tth produces a hash value consisting of four letters. First, tth divides the message into blocks of 16 letters, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. If the message length is not divisible by 16, it is padded out with nulls. A four-number running total is maintained that starts out with the value (0, 0, 0, 0); this is input to the compression function for processing the first block. The com- pression function consists of two rounds.
2. Consider the SHA-3 option with a block size of 1024 bits and assume that each of the lanes in the first message block (P0) has at least one nonzero bit. To start, all of the lanes in the internal state matrix that correspond to the capacity portion of the initial state are all zeros. Show how long it will take before all of these lanes have at least one nonzero bit. Note: Ignore the permutation. That is, keep track of the original zero lanes even after they have changed position in the matrix.
