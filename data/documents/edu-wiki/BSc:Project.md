Course outline
--------------


The primary goal of this course is for each student to pursue an independent project related to computer science. Each project will be pursued under the supervision of the supervisor of a student. A supervisor will be either a faculty member of Innopolis University or an industry partner. A project topic of a student will be decided through discussion with the student and his/her supervisor. Each student should carry out a project individually. However, it is allowed for two or three students work closely on similar topics, supervised by a common supervisor.


In this first part, students will be encouraged to concentrate on building software artifacts using knowledge they learned through their academic years.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


* Students will be able to develop medium to large sized projects on their own (under the supervision of supervisors).
* Students will be able to write reports about their projects effectively.
* Students will be able to present their projects effectively.
