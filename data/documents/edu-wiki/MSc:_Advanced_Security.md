Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


In this course, server-based and application-based web attacks are taught. We begin by exploring advanced techniques and attacks to which all modern-day complex applications may be vulnerable to. We will learn about new web frameworks and web back-ends, then explore encryption as it relates to web applications, digging deep into practical cryptography used by the web, including techniques to identify the type of encryption in use within the application and methods for exploiting or abusing it. In this course, we will also focus on wireless security such as Bluetooth and WiFi and will dive deeper into the security mechanisms used in the modern-day technologies. Furthermore, we will look into assembly language, assemblers and debuggers that will help us to assess and protect networks and applications. Other important topics in advanced security include Web Application Firewall (WAF) and web vulnerability scanners. Software security is another exciting topic that will be covered in detail in AS. It is worth mentioning that AS is a defensive course where the emphasis will be put on the defensive mechanisms.
