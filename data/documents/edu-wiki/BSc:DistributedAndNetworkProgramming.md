Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


Distributed and networked systems have become an integral part of our life, we use various applications such as chatting, online transactions, or cloud storage apps. All these popular applications are supported by an infrastructure (of servers) that is organized based on some concepts of distributed systems. The purpose of this course is to provide the students with the necessary concepts, models, and real-world problem-solving techniques of network programming and distributed systems.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Concepts of network programming
* Different distributed system architectures
* Various synchronization and coordination techniques
* Different consistency models and replication methods
* Approaches to achieve fault tolerance and security in distributed systems


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Difference between different transport protocols, when and why one is preferred over another
* Difference between different distributed system architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid)
* How a mutual exclusion is achieved between concurrent servers (centralized, distributed, token-ring, and decentralized)
* How a new leader is elected in peer-to-peer systems (bully, ring)
* How to achieve a consistent replicas across distributed systems (consistency models and protocols, content replication and placement)
* Some methods to achieve the fault tolerance in distributed systems


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...
