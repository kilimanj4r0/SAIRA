Short Description
-----------------


This course is a combination of mentorship and workshops created for the support and development of a student-founder during his study. All workshops are practically oriented and help to systematize and practically imply all knowledge and skills. Moreover, the workshop has an important psychological meaning for a founder - they are designed to help to reflect, get the answers for important questions and overcome the challenges. Individual work with mentors is combined with group meetings where students progress the creation of their community of the founders and can share their opinions, thoughts, etc. In addition to that, the workshops are targeting to train founders to effectively face important events/cases (“critical incidents”) that happen in their entrepreneurial life.
