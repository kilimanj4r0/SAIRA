Course outline
--------------


Building high-quality software is utmost important. However, it is easier said than done. Building bug-free software is almost an impossible task, if there is no help from automated tools. In this course, students will learn techniques used in quality assurance tools. In particular, this course will be focused on static analysis and testing, both of which are widely used in industry.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


* Students will be able to understand and apply static analysis.
* Students will be able to understand and apply diverse testing techniques.
* Students will be able to understand and apply formal verification techniques.
* Students will be able to understand and apply data-driven bug detection techniques.
