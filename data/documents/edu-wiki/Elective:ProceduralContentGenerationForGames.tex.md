Procedural Content Generation for Games
=======================================


Procedural Content Generation (PCG) allows for parameter models of designs to create content with minimal user interventions, or to provide a human with an overview of possible designs. Techniques involving generative methods, search based algorithms, and evolution, give the designer control over large design spaces. These techniques are at the forefront in novel tools for game design and assets: expanding replay-ability, reducing costs and entry points for asset creation, and allowing for personalized play experiences. These methods have also found their way into other industries, such as, fashion, architecture, and industrial design. This course aims to provide a project based approach to learning these techniques. Students finish the course with a portfolio of designs generated by PCG methods, understand how to use parameter models for designs and evaluate the designs using quantitative measures, and have a foundation in computational creativity.
