Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


The Introduction to Programming course teaches the fundamental concepts and skills necessary to perform programming at a professional level. Students will learn how to master the fundamental control structures, data structures, reasoning patterns and programming language mechanisms characterizing modern programming, as well as the fundamental rules of producing high-quality software. They will acquire the necessary programming background for later courses introducing programming skills in specialized application areas. The course focuses on Object Oriented paradigm.

* Concept of typification. Dynamic and static types.
* Concepts of structured programming, object-oriented one.
* Concepts of exception handling and generic programming.
* Concurrent programming and functional programming in imperative programming languages.
* verification of the software based on programming by contract (C)


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* How to create high quality software using mainstream concepts of programming.
* What is object-oriented programming and its main advantages
