Data Modeling and Databases I
=============================


* **Course name:** Data Modeling and Databases I
* **Course number:** BS-


Course characteristics
----------------------


### Key concepts of the class


* Data Modeling
* Databases


### What is the purpose of this course?


Software development has been paired since early days with management of storage and persistency tools. In this course, the classic approach to relational databases will be presented from the design phase via entity-relationship diagrams to the implementation via queries formulated in Structured Query Language (SQL). Students will learn how to model data and use relational databases.



### Course Objectives Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy


### - What should a student remember at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to recognize and define



* Define what software requirements are
* List different commercial and non-commercial DBMS
* Define Entity Relationship model
* List different kind of operators of Relational Algebra
* Define Normal Forms and Functional dependencies
* List basic clauses of SQL queries


### - What should a student be able to understand at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to describe and explain (with examples)



* Describe the basic machinery behind DBMS
* Explain Strengths and weaknesses relational model
* Explain the objectives of the normalization process
* Abstract systems using ER model


### - What should a student be able to apply at the end of the course?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to apply



* Formally modelling a database system
* Reasoning requirements collected from stakeholders and model them using ER diagrams
* Coding in programming languages and interfacing with SQL APIs
* Using transformation approaches to match ER diagrams and relational model
