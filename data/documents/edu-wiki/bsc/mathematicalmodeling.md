Course outline
--------------


The overall goal of this course is to enable students to build mathematical models of real-world systems, analyze them and make predictions about behavior of these systems. Variety of modeling techniques will be discussed with examples taken from physics, biology, chemistry, economics and other fields. The focus of the course will be on seeking the connections between mathematics and physical systems, studying and applying various modeling techniques to creating mathematical description of these systems, and using this analysis to make predictions about the systemâ€™s behavior.



Expected learning outcomes
--------------------------


After completing this course, a student will be able to:



* Assess and articulate what type of modeling techniques are appropriate for a given physical system.
* Construct a mathematical model of a given physical system and analyze it.
* Make predictions of the behavior of a given physical system based on the analysis of its mathematical model.
