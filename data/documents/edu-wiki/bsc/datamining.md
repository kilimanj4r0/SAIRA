Course outline
--------------


This course is designed for undergraduate students to provide core techniques of data processing and applications. Data Mining is an analytic process, which explores large data sets (also known as big data) to discover consistent patterns. This computational process involves a use of methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. This course will discuss advanced algorithms for classification, clustering, association analysis, and mining social network analysis. The subjects are treated both theoretically and practically through lab sessions.
