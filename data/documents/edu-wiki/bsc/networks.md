Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
---------------------------------


### What is the main purpose of this course?


This is an introductory course to Computer Networks. During the course, we will introduce the fundamental principles behind modern computer networks, including the OSI reference model, the fundamental communication protocols, network topologies, and peer-to-peer and client-server architectures for network applications. We will also cover the basic C functions for network programming, as well as software tools to monitor data packets in a network, the configuration of routers and routing algorithms. We will conclude the course with covering the modern problems of existing computer networks, including the security aspects.



### ILOs defined at three levels


#### Level 1: What concepts should a student know/remember/explain?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Layered structure of a computer network
* Topologies in computer networks
* Addressing schemes in networks
* Routing algorithms
* Security at different TCP/IP layers
* Nuts and bolts of applications in networks


#### Level 2: What basic practical skills should a student be able to perform?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* How a network is formed
* How addressing is done at different layers of the networks
* How subnets are created
* How different routing protocols work and which one is better in which scenario
* How medium is accessed on a network
* How different networks operate
* And Demonstrate the knowledge and discuss the overal functioning of a computer network


#### Level 3: What complex comprehensive skills should a student be able to apply in real-life scenarios?


By the end of the course, the students should be able to ...



* Configure networks
* Configure routing
* Perform TCP and UDP connections
* Create networks and subnets
* Write simple network applications through sockets
