Computer Graphics in Game Development
=====================================


* **Course name**: Computer Graphics in Game Development
* **Code discipline**: CSE811
* **Subject area**: Software Engineering


Short Description
-----------------


This course gives a fundamental knowledge of computer graphics algorithms with main focus on real-time applications (including games). As soon as computer graphics is being GPU-accelerated, a major row of fundamental graphics tasks and issues are hidden by GPU graphics libraries and engines. To research these tasks and issues students will implement their own renders both from scratch as using low-level graphical API.
The main goal of this course is to practice creating own renderers. Working individually with instructor guidance, students will create CPU rasterizer, ray tracer, and GPU-accelerated rasterizer based on DirectX12.

### The retake exam


**Section 1**



1. The retake is related to the worst activity result. If a student doesn't pass the test, during the retake the student will take the final test once again. If a student doesn't finish assessments, during the retake the student will redo the assessments.
2. P7. Activities and Teaching Methods by Sections
3. Mark what techniques and methods are used in each section (1 is used, 0 is not used).
